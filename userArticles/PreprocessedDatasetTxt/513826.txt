duplicate address soon one node chooses given address strong dad multiple nodes chosen particular address given time least one nodes detect duplicate within fixed interval time 1 alternative would require nodes detect duplication chose less demanding quirement even requirement shown impossible satisfy implying stronger requirement impossible well proposed requirement strong dad defined formally strong dad let address assigned tenta tively otherwise node time undefined node chosen address time address undefined define set sat set nodes assigned address time strong dad algorithm must ensure within 1 repeated application requirement two nodes chosen address eventually one nodes chosen duplicate address detect duplication finite bounded time interval least one node detect sat 1 argue strong dad impossible certain conditions simple observation partitions occur unbounded 2 intervals time strong dad impossible observation obvious intuitive impossibility result applies protocol 16 well elaborate claim let ad hoc network partitioned say two partitions remain unbounded interval time case two nodes two partitions choose address algorithm detect duplicates within bounded time interval since nodes two partitions cannot communicate timely manner perkins et al 16 suggest partitions merge dad algorithm executed order detect duplicate addresses also suggest performed way avoids congestion caused messages sent purpose duplicate address detection note using 16 partitions merge addresses nodes must checked duplicates 16 however indicate merging partitions detected congestion caused dad messages may reduced also remains period vulnerability partitions merge detection merging partitions subsequent detection duplicate addresses requires amount time time nodes assigned

delays message delays unpredictable proposed approach described section 4 need use partition detection procedures theorem generalizes impossibility observation theorem strong dad cannot guaranteed message delays least one pair nodes network unbounded proof assume exists node pair message delay unbounded particular assume delay nodes x unbounded suppose nodes x choose addresses b respectively time assume nodes already chosen unique addresses distinct b two possibilities b case b case since message delays nodes x unbounded note x cannot guaranteed receive within bounded unbounded time interval one bound exists terval time message node vice versa consider node z delay sending message z bounded delay along path z x must unbounded otherwise message x delivered via z bounded interval time contradicting assumption implies node x cannot receive message within bounded time node whose state causally dependent node ys state time summary argument implies node x cannot receive message within bounded time node another node whose state causally depends node ys state essentially node x receive message help determine within bounded time whether node assigned address sim ilarly node cannot know whether node x assigned address words nodes x cannot distinguish two cases possible ie b therefore strong dad cannot guaranteed message delays node pair unbounded 2 theorem states unbounded delays preclude strong dad however message delays bounded strong dad fact achieved note bounded delay assumption requires partitions last bounded duration time ie assumption valid message delays need bounded despite temporary partitions may occur bounded delay assumption dad schemes proposed 2 16 perform strong dad choosing large enough timeout interval scheme 16 described section 2 ever practice particularly presence partitions may possible bound message delays impossibility strong dad conditions likely occur practical ad hoc network motivates us consider weaker version duplicate address detection 4 weak duplicate address detection delays ad hoc networks always bounded even message delays bounded determining bound nontrivial particularly size network may large possibly unknown impossibility strong dad presence unbounded delays implies timeoutbased duplicate address detection schemes 2 16 always detect duplicate addresses motivated observations propose weak duplicate address detection alternative strong dad weak dad unlike strong dad achieved despite unbounded message delays proposed weak dad mechanism used either independently conjunction schemes 16

ip x takes additional steps inform nodes duplicate addresses 4 however entry ip x found routing state node z normal processing link state information occurs node z required link state routing algorithm modification node say node z previously forwarded packet destination address towards one node say node w never forward packet destination address towards another node say node x even w x assigned address see observe initially node zs routing table entry address leads node w thus initially node z must key node w associated address routing table node z would previously received status

shown figure 3b assume node wants send packet destined node destination ip address packets header recall next hop destination per routing table b node knows mac address corresponding ip address b node

forward corresponding network layers network layers nodes p q thereafter forward packet according local routing table entries towards nodes r respectively manner nodes r receive packet sent node unacceptable per requirements weak dad note problem arises two nodes r ip address two nodes p q mac address particular two nodes sharing mac address neighbors common node node easy see problem occur two nodes mac address must within two hops ie must common neighbor therefore nodes mac address guaranteed unique within two hops problem described occur suggest two solutions overcome problem detect

thus intended destination node actually deliver packet upper layers note key destination node available routing table seen example link state routing protocol 5 enhanced weak duplicate address detection weak dad described suers one shortcoming may manifest unexpected behavior upper layer protocols shortcoming illustrated using figure 3 discussion let us ignore mac addresses shown figure 3 pretend mac addresses unique consider figure 3a let us assume application layer node r provides certain service called foo network partitioned figure performs service discovery service foo discovers

f figure 3 problem caused duplicate mac duplicate ip addresses two partitions merge shown figure 3b partitions merge application layer node performs service discovery service foo learns node e service available node ip address thereafter node sends service request ip address request delivered node recall node routing table entry address leads packet along route apfm node thus request delivered node r actually provides service foo case node would receive requested service scenario occur despite weak dad 6 scenario could potentially dealt application software ie service client service discovery mecha nism however following consider approach network layer address problem 7 unintended outcome occurs node relies information provided node e nodes e know two dierent nodes assigned address thus state nodes e inconsistent note 6 node may eventually discover duplication address instance example using link state routing node may eventually receive link state update node r time node would detect duplication address however node learns duplication requests may still reach wrong node also using routing protocols duplication address may detected longer intervals time 7 problem described context weak dad occur duplicate address detection schemes well past work considered issue instance using 16 let us assume two partitions nodes exists also assume ip address use partition suppose node x learns service foo node ip address one partition thereafter node x moves second partition node x attempts use service foo request would delivered node second partition service actually provided node first partition enhancement described avoids problems scenarios similar also occur information propagated several nodes instance node f figure may later learn service foo node avoid situation layer network layer node say node x delivered packet another node potentially several hops away network layer node x must aware ip address pairs known sender packet 8 ensure protocol layers network layer ie routing protocol node x use packet sent another node whose ip address keypair database inconsistent node x modified version weak dad satisfy condition referred enhanced weak dad enhanced weak dad

ie forward route request xs neighbors route requests also considered upper layer packets node x since ip packet containing forwarded request sent network layer node x ie upper layer neighbor node x keeps track new ip address may learned since last sending upper layer packet neighbor one possible approach implementing would maintain sequence number node x would incremented time node x learns new ip address pair ip address key pairs cached node x tagged sequence number pair received node x also neighbor node node x would record sequence number node x last updated neighbor ip address key database node x sending upper layer packet neighbor node x first verifies whether updated node known ip address entries sequence number sy node last updated smaller current sequence number node x node x first sends node ip address key entries database tagged sequence number greater sy since frequency new ip address key pairs learned likely low ip packets processing incur additional overhead except compare current sequence number node x recorded neighbor packet sent 9 modifications problem described context service discovery similar problems prevented one concern enhanced version size ip address key database exchanged neighbors database may grow size time potentially increasing overhead enhanced weak dad limitedterm leases ip addresses discussed section help reduce overhead somewhat however worthwhile investigating approaches well discussed implementation weak dad conjunction link state routing next section 9 alternative keeping track ip address key updates perneighbor basis would follows whenever node discovers new neighbor exchange known ip address key pairs neighbor also sending upper layer packet neighbor node ensure neighbors updated new ip address key pairs learned since sending last upper layer packet modification necessary maintain sequence number described earlier however node needs exchange ip address key pairs nodes previous approach thereby trading overhead maintaining sequence numbers overhead additional trac neighbors since node x may always know neighbor nodes packets promiscuously received neighbor z also necessary incorporate mechanism allow

obtained combining enhanced weak dad scheme described timeoutbased mechanism 16 dad schemes particular proposed 16 summarized section 2 node wishing assign address may choose address randomly using locally available infor mation node may send route request message randomly chosen address route reply received within timeout interval determined chosen address already use route reply received route request may optionally sent times route reply still received node may assign chosen address however hybrid scheme provisions enhanced weak dad also incorporated thus timeoutbased mechanism detect duplicate address within single partition high probability duplicate addresses escape mechanism provisions weak dad scheme ensure duplicate addresses detected eventu ally hybrid scheme may potentially detect duplicate addresses sooner using weak dad alone use weak dad makes robust partitions large message delays unlike scheme 16 thus hybrid scheme provide benefits component schemes 8 floodingbased routing protocols believe enhanced weak dad implemented conjunction routing protocols one notable exception typically packet forwarded source destination hop unicast next node route destination

protocols weak dad works correctly even routingrelated control packets route flooded data packets flooded data packets flooded without using hopofhop forwarding using unicasts explicit routing information eg routing table 15 7 route cache 6 used purpose routing data packets destinations therefore weak dad mechanism relies mismatching associated routing information cannot help detect duplicate addresses due high overhead flooding unlikely choice routing data packets destinations ever researchers proposed selectively piggybacking data packets routing control packets route requests may flooded also protocols use limited flooding deliver data also proposed 1 protocols data packets may flooded part network may result data packet delivered multiple nodes may assigned identical ip address violating requirements weak dad problem developing satisfactory duplicate address detection scheme works despite unbounded message delays using floodinglike routing protocols remains open using floodingbased schemes data delivery partial solution require node flood ip address key pair network period ically scheme however two drawbacks high overhead due periodic flooding keys b period vulnerability packets may delivered multiple nodes grows time interval consecutive floods ip address key pairs thus attempt reduce flooding overhead increases period vulnerability reiterate point
