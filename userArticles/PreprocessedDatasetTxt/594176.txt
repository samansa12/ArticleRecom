trivially decided checking whether leading coefficient positive generalize observation multivariate case notion leading monomial must generalized new method essentially based one generalization call dominating monomial definition 41 dominating monomial say monomial dominates monomial iff divides different say dominating monomial p iff monomial p dominating 2 example 41 let us consider polynomials three dominating monomials p two q univariate polynomials one dominating monomial leading monomial 2 ready describe new method 1 collect dominating monomials p 2 coefficients positive output yes else output proof correctness method given later theorem 42 let us first get familiar method working several small examples example 42 check following polynomial eventually absolutely positive one sees immediately dominating monomial xyz since coefficient positive polynomial eventually absolutely positive let us try another one sees dominating monomials x 4 2xy 3 since coefficients positive polynomial eventually absolutely positive let us try still another obtained changing signs previous example dominating monomials x 4 gamma2xy 3 3x 2 since one coefficient negative polynomial eventually absolutely positive 2 remark note one use dominating monomial method quick prepruning method testing absolute positiveness suppose would like check whether polynomialp absolutely positive first apply cheap dominating monomial method turns p eventually absolutely positive need carry expensive absolute positiveness check since already know answer 2 remaining section devoted proving correctness dominating monomial method theorem 42 begin lemma justifies notion dominating monomial lemma 42 set dominating monomials p oe p 2 proof let dominating monomial p need show dominating monomial oe p prove contradiction assume dominating monomial oe p two cases ffl monomial oe p ffl monomial oe p dominating case 1 monomial oe p note monomial oe since monomial oe p must monomial q different p monomial q 0 oe q degree vector every monomial oe q divides q particular q 0 divides q since q 0 degree vector divides q recall different q thus q dominates therefore dominating monomial p contradiction case 2 monomial oe p dominating thus monomial q 0 oe p dominates hence monomial q p monomial q oe q degree vector q 0 every monomial oe q divides q particular q divides q since q 0 q degree vector q 0 divides q recall q 0 dominates thus divides q 0 differ ent since q 0 divides q see divides q different thus q dominates dominating monomial p contradiction thus must dominating monomial oe p let dominating monomial oe p need show dominating monomial p done exactly way since following theorem relates notions eventual absolute positiveness dominating monomials proving correctness dominating monomial method theorem 42 polynomial p eventually absolutely positive iff coefficients dominating monomials p positive 2 proof assume p eventually absolutely positive show coefficients dominating monomials positive eventual absolute positiveness p know exists p absolutely positive theorem 31 know oe p must coefficients positive nonzero constant term therefore also coefficients dominating monomials oe p posi tive lemma 42 set dominating monomials p oe p thus dominating monomials p positive coefficients assume coefficients dominating monomials p positive need prove p eventually absolutely positive begin taking care trivial case nondominating monomials polynomial p also positive coefficients easily seen polynomial absolutely positive 0 therefore eventually absolutely positive therefore assume exists least one monomial negative coefficient negative monomial p partition polynomial p sum several subpolynomials one subpolynomials consists positive nondominating monomials p remaining subpolynomials consists exactly one dominatingmono mial p call leading monomial possible none monomials dominated leading monomial thus monomials negative obviously subpolynomial eventually absolutely positive p thus show subpolynomial eventually absolutely positive let q one subpolynomials q consists positive monomials absolutely positive 0 therefore eventually absolutely positive thus assume q least one negative monomial first prove q eventually positive let claim q positive 5 see first recall x dominates x e every hence see immediately every every x ab thus see every x q q eventually positive remains show every partial derivative q exists q nonnegative obvious every vanishing derivative nonnegative thus let q nonvanishing partial derivative polynomial q note q consists positive leading monomial derivative leading monomial q possibly none negative monomials dominated leading monomial thus applying idea used showing eventual positiveness q see exists q positive therefore also nonnegative finitely many derivatives take maximum bound positiveness polynomial q bounds nonnegativeness derivatives polynomial q absolutely positive thus q eventually absolutely positive showed every sub polynomial p eventually absolutely positive therefore p also eventually absolutely positive 2 43 comparing complexity method know partial derivative
