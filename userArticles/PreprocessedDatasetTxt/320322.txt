distributed working environment centred around poor feedback applications used included lack feedback online many instances assumption everybody always logged netmeeting running background clearly case furthermore indication show members group joined netmeeting session using chat application students found visual clue someone actively typing comment frequently led confusion example often difficult determine members group still whether still paying attention table 2 functions vws resource room hinder group work main function comments realtime group work lack control poor audio inadequate feedback whats happening endactivities related work resource room badly structured version update facility userfriendly end many copiesdrafts documentsasynchronous shared work better

method posting messages grant individuals ability manage messagesshared storage area unaware else access group area unable collaborate earlier versions documentsno times mentioned students asked name two functions students sometimes experienced difficulties knowing method communication use felt would useful netmeeting way alerting user current method communication used method communication used initiate collaborative working session example one stage lecturer trying dialogue student via chat application student frantically trying reset audio microphone settings home chat window minimized pc would useful student known tool set first place another case student initiated communication lecturer using chat tool however lecturer conducted audio meeting another student assumed would using tool next student audio seemed preferred method realtime communication students unfortunately student audio equipment meeting delayed could set microphone speakers privacy main issues raised students relation privacy within distributed working environment centred around lecturers accessibility work boundaries groups taking module students asked whether aware lecturers module could read content everything private group study room students aware suspected visual clue 73 students said affect use group study room probably people see group study area public place anyway remaining 27 students felt process writing draft reports compromised given often wanted post comments felt suitable viewing members group students found boundaries groups tightly drawn able interact groups going module would also using vsp resource rooms intentional design act lecturers order discourage students collaborating anybody group members testing scenarios however students found closeness group study area inconvenience wanted collaborate share experiences someone another group lecturers module netmeeting call additional source interruption top telephone students knocking door one point lecturer meeting office couple students trying call using netmeeting serious distraction took minutes send calls away students felt technology go way helping lecturers contactable students found vsp group study rooms offered completely private places contents group study rooms could viewed lecturers open public spaces might provide opportunities informal interactions eg akin coffee machine corridor etc students added document group work area wanted able explicitly grant deny permission member group would allowed formation subgroups within working area direct control students conventions interaction main issues raised students relation conventions interaction largely concerned establishing general principles control shared workspace guidelines interaction required collaborative session following areas taking control session opening another application top groups collaborative work space indicating desire relinquish control another leaving closing session starting netmeeting students experienced confusion control expect first member group click mouse would retain control fact someone else control ones mouse stopped working made difficult break take control groups resorted coordination file sharing using telephone whilst another group used chat board coordinate ownership control groups found members wanted add amend document cooperation screen control essential students felt spent much time fighting control group described collaborative session war like fact one member group control actions member group sometimes result chaos students one group annoyed actions one particular member insisted opening nonshared windows shared workspace result participants shared window blacked another group student control netmeeting session decided leave meeting shut application result application two machines also disappeared unfortunately instance work lost redone cases students clearly find difficult indicate desire leave collaborative session unaware consequences members quit reflection several students felt group agreed unique indicating wish leave collaborative session terms ability vsp group study room create cohesion within group almost threequarters students 74 felt study room united group helped work together effectively however students considered case long members made proper effective use available features beyond monitor keyboard use audiovideo technology augment textbased communications explored study clear preferences different communication media different levels proficiency using students found responses lecturers rather brief chat used communication medium switched audio longer problem clearly people dislike much typing cases students found wait long time messages appear due slow typing speeds members group setup procedure audio technology userfriendly took trialand error sometimes group resort using telephone order get settings right lack multicasting audiovideo means onetoone connection possible even multiuser conferencing session made unsuitable group work involving two people obviously serious drawback groups least 4 members without audio link users found annoying confusing switch different windows even minor task example using chat communicate intentions back one windows perform task system level functionality important functional requirements arising evaluation considered many students first time used netmeeting group work learning context reaction application interesting students liked fun using could see potential although limitations addressing human issues made application hindered group work students reported used forced order adhere requirements module others felt limitations netmeeting made collaborative sessions recreational activity opportunity serious discussion collaboration found application suitable providing level detail required work great students liked availability private group study rooms allowed structure space liked group area also proved useful helping keep track groups progress students noticed need agreement members group use room also remarked need general housekeeping tasks shared document area easy end collection drafts outofdate information found easy take unilateral decision delete files temporary trash suggested also provision log files record transactions file modifications deletions directory suggested although group study area favourably received students notice deficiency integrating workspace using favourite tools common information space integration currently seamless provision scheduling tools project management also considered important requirement user interface students clearly preferred user interface ui intuitive degree familiarity ie used ui components number metaphors omitted vsp resource rooms requested students including drag drop functionality ability bookmark pages ability perform tasks across group resources eg deleting group files students could descipher meaning couple icons intuitively required help tooltips later versions browser ie internet explorer v40 feature synchronous session desktop could become cluttered example separate windows chat shared applications couple others searching information problem exacerbated students using small monitors students liked range user interfaces provided vsp clickable image whole room eg lecturers personal office purely textbased pages used resource room however students clearly higher expectation feeling virtual space students commented lot pages looked similar rather dull uninspiring insufficient opportunities interaction throughout vsp site finally groups found network connection quality always reliable especially using modem internet service provider isp also students requested training use vsp resource rooms synchronous asynchronous facilities students given quick demonstration vsp purpose course rest intuitive discussion terms acceptability students evaluation found asynchronous environment worked reasonably well however synchronous realtime environment still falling short ubiquitous presenting obstacles group working requires interaction multimedia space hci present limited application multimedia systems 22 good ideas research communities improving realtime collaborative environments discussed earlier sections currently still tough balancing act designers groupware applications provide awareness
