hessian matrix 4lx simplifying resulting expression using equation 33 obtain ffi x 14 chandrasekaran golub gu sayed observe matrix ffi positive definite since one nonpositive eigenvalue implies 4lx positive definite det 4lx 0 indeed det ffi x x ffi x last expression rewritten using svd 38 det x ffi x ffi x ffi x ffi ff x ffi comparing last expression function gff 310 finally det ff lemma 32 g 0 ff 0 consequently 4lx must positive definite hence x must local minimizer lx since lx convex function also means x global minimizer lx still need consider points lx differentiable include solution consider first case b 2 6 0 means b belong column span hence need check follows lemma 33 gff unique positive root ff follows lemma 35 ffi global minimum hand condition 313 hold follows lemma 33 gff positive root hence global minimum consider case b means b lies column span case lx differentiable new method parameter estimation uncertain condition 316 holds follows lemma 34 gff unique positive ff
