route discovery works follows whenever traffic source needs route destination initiates route discovery flooding route request rreq destination network waits route reply rrep intermediate node receives first copy rreq packet sets reverse path source using previous hop rreq next hop reverse path addition valid route available desti nation unicasts rrep back source via reverse path otherwise rebroadcasts rreq packet duplicate copies rreq immediately discarded upon reception every node destination receiving first copy rreq packet forms reverse path way intermediate nodes also unicasts rrep back source along reverse path rrep proceeds towards source establishes forward path destination hop aodv also includes mechanisms erasing broken routes following link failure expiring old unused

successful paths formed copies satisfy route update rules provide loopfree paths 19 copies simply discarded note different basic aodv first copy looked rreq copy intermediate node creates updates reverse path intermediate node valid path destination rreq copy rebroadcasted provided first copy yields reverse path somewhat similar basic aodv first copies rreq forwarded prevent looping flood contrary intermediate node valid path destination checks whether rrep already sent route discovery sends back rrep along newly formed reverse path remembers next hop used rrep otherwise rreq copy dropped destination receives copies rreqs also forms reverse paths way intermediate nodes however unlike intermediate nodes destination sends back rrep along new reverse path multiple replies destination allow exploration multiple reverse paths concurrently thus speeding search bidirectional path contrast allowing multiple destination replies basic aodv little benefit unless replies take nonoverlapping paths source intermediate nodes one reverse path back source intermediate node receives rrep follows route update rules 19 form loopfree forward path desti nation possible else rrep dropped supposing intermediate node forms forward path one valid reverse paths source checks reverse paths previously used send rrep route discovery chooses one reverse paths forward current rrep also
