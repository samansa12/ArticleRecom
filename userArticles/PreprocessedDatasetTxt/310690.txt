service provider estimate delay distribution mean exploiting estimated servicetime distributions need exponential elapsed service times customers service frame reference classical loss system servers working parallel extra waiting space assuming blocked customers depart without affecting future arrivals allowing waiting helps avoid blocking thus serve customers however many loss systems telephone access blocked customers easily retry rapidly automatic redialers customers easily retry system without provision waiting tends behave like system provision waiting however contend usually better directly allow waiting advantage customers retrying customers receive service service provider avoids cost maintaining queue however retrying typically imposes costs customers service provider first customer must expend time effort retrying second even unsuccessful attempts often consume resources service provider typically resources required process request service whether successful thus service providers processing capacity may reduced handle many unsuccessful attempts moreover retrials firstcome firstserved service discipline lost fcfs discipline often strongly preferred customers inherent fairness random order service associated retrials also makes waiting time beginning service variable tends detrimental thus several reasons motivating service providers directly allow waiting given service provider allows waiting two alternatives service provider may either communicate anticipated delays customers upon arrival contend service provider decided allow waiting usually much
