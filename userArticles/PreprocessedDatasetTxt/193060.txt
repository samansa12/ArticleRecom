appreciate fact listen talk continue work office nice dont track conference room foreign building nice dont wait conference room talk start however convenience comes cost reduced interactivity unless mechanisms provided overcome barrier distance interaction mechanisms provided forum enable certain degree audience participation users said greatly enhanced experience giving attending talk however distributed nature audience certain detrimental effects overcome interaction tools effectiveness interaction tools forum enabled audiences see talk speaker natural part facetoface presentations also provided technologydriven interaction tools namely poll written comments video audio effective elements enabling twoway interaction technologybased mechanisms played surprisingly important roles well audience asked spoken questions varying degrees every talk speakers used forum present prepared materials took questions audience end others took questions arose presentation nearly every speaker said voice interaction audience important give sense audiences interest level understanding provide sense efforts worthwhile speakers also said liked seeing picture person speaking especially familiar person name audiences point view video important creating connection speaker speaker looked camera appeared audience member speaking directly one user put feels intimate live talk large audience presenter maybe officemate side room written questions useful feature enabled speakers audience members flexibility handling questions speakers used traditional method waiting end take written questions others used chance take break prepared materials regain connection audience one speaker said looked written questions started lose sense audience audiences end people able ask questions arose minds rather waiting good time break people tend shy talking front group able contribute comments working microphones experiencing audio problems general written comments tended expressed concisely spoken ones poll meter unconventional feedback mechanism provided also enthusiastically received asking poll questions talk enabled speakers find answer question also assure people one speaker used fivechoice poll talk upcoming academy awards presented choices major award held discussion nominee asked audience vote winner use poll kept audience highly engaged gave speaker strong sense audiences attitudes general audiences liked poll gave opportunity indicate presence well express opinion said especially liked anonymous method expressing feedback nice able anonymously raise hand say wrong answer feel embarrassed one user wrote finally slides also effective maintaining shared focus among speaker audience traditional talk surprised one speaker four used annotations used audience members said effective helping focus attention especially first getting used interface addition displaying slides everyones desktop eliminated visibility problems often occur facetoface talks large audiences audience members said missed part talk looked back slides fill said asking question checked previous slides make sure question hadnt already covered limitations interaction tools although mechanisms interaction effective clear provide full range communication interactions reduced part limitations technology design also distributed environment changed affordance certain behaviors particular audiences found difficult avoid splitting attention talk work activities available offices audiences gain speakers loss dramatic way forum talks differed facetoface ones audience freedom vary level participation freedom often came expense speakers satisfaction experience forums onetomany setting information audience activity much sparser speaker result social pressures regulate behavior colocated audiences greatly diminished allowed audience members behave ways acceptable among local audience example common audience members pay attention talks interesting periods read email focus work slower periods nearly every user responded surveys mentioned forums greatest advantage enabled get work done less interesting parts talk audience members also chose take certain interruptions phone calls visitors would missed attending talk meeting room freedom could also burden however many users trouble ignoring distractions office even interested talk amount effort required attend talk much lower people signed talks potentially interest knowing could decide leave without calling attention 1 1 certain people wellknown around company said particularly appreciated ability leave discreetly especially vulnerable insulting speakers leave talk said regret avoid talks marginal interest reason fact audience members could scroll slides independently speaker people scanned slides talk began decide whether wanted stay rest presentation finally sometimes people watched talks small groups enabled make comments content talk even speaker without rude speakers point view however fact audience paying less attention usual created situations detracted experience giving talk example asking audience vote issue speakers felt dis appointed insulted portion audience responded way knowing whether audience members phone away desks certainly cues indicating audience members less interested topic usual cost attending low speakers found disturbing audience members asked issue already addressed clearly indicating hadnt paying attention fact technical course taught mixed audience local audience members said people attending forum seemed less intelligent often asked questions already addressed hand interested find certain speakers tended get anxious giving talks front crowd said found relaxing give talk forum sitting comfortable office talking camera perhaps one person room enabled treat talk informal presen tation said able concentrate material rather worrying perceived still dynamic speakers depend heavily audience feedback felt quite constrained technology feedback reduced expected number ways limited bandwidth reduced amount feedback ways detracted audience speakers experience disconcerting among lack laughter applause noticed speakers tended pause saying something amusing waiting response moved awkwardly got none seemed find particularly uncomfortable end talks without applause provide clo sure one speaker ended talk thanking audience members participation expressing hope learned something talk informing could reach talk even wishing good afternoon finally signing certain audience members said uncomfortable smooth way expressing amusement joke appreciation end talk fact observed number cases audience members spontaneously thanked speaker end talk even though werent transmitting voice speaker although audiences apparent unresponsiveness uncomfortable speakers found many received feedback audience members week talk many said acquaintances even strangers approached tell enjoyed talk ask follow questions encounters gratifying getting immediate response presentation said enhance satisfaction experience another problem collaboration audience members asked question could indicate satisfaction speakers response noticed occasions speaker spent long time addressing issue long questioner felt question answered speakers handled problem asking answer ques tion others said felt frustrated couldnt tell covered issue questioner mind end audience members mentioned wished could indicated subtle way satisfied answer course problem occur large presentations speaker may able see asked question therefore cannot tell provided adequate answer behaviors interpreted differently noticed interesting cases audiences behaved forum similarly way facetoface talk behavior interpreted differently none theless use poll one example using forum speakers sometimes asked audience vote indicate opinion matter sometimes ask local audiences raise hands purpose situations face toface talk common everyone express opinion people wait see others voting respond although behaviors often happened forum speakers reported found audiences behavior unre sponsive explicitly prompted voting express opinion others repeated question response wasnt immediate part difference interpretation may due capabilities provided forum interface trivial forum add number votes option compare total attendance obvious everyone votes facetoface talk audiences must first vote one option second clear people abstain also speakers found less comfortable waiting votes come forum talk could look around room see people reacting effect particularly interesting stemmed considered added functionality compared facetoface talk nice know exactly many people attending many voting option interesting concrete information provided people likely interpret rather ordinary behavior uncooperative part appeal technology support distributed presentations enables potentially large groups people participate particular audience members perception presentation vary little whether audience dozen several hundred members effect makes large group presentations feel inti mate also reduces audience members awareness awareness helps audiences understand behave appropriately provides context interpret impact talk important tools designed support large group participation enable sense awareness participants effectiveness awareness tools initial attempt create awareness providing list attendees names audience window users could click see persons picture basic information speakers audiences browsed list talk see attending often clicked name see pictures friends connect face unfamiliar name times audience members visited participants offices talk seeing name list spoke talk participants encountered several days list also important helping speakers target talk audience decided allow users watch anonymously felt participants given opportunity adjust comments particular people audience still list alone fairly limited added ability send short text messages participants enabled people pass notes talk without rude talks included facility quarter audience sent message sometimes make comment talk times discuss plans even crack jokes messages quite short exchanges consisted four turns sometimes spread hour talk participants usually always alternated turns audience members used messages indicated surveys found capability effective interacting others one user put tell another audience member agreedisagree said point get information etc still majority audience members yet discover messages expect message capability likely increase use time people discover receive message someone used limitations awareness tools despite attempts create sense shared environ ment clear speakers audiences feel much like shared common experience facetoface presentation several people commented understanding audience members largely depended extent speaker involved audience presentations talks speakers asked many poll questions encouraged audience questions left audience much greater sense community gave lecturestyle presentations course also true facetoface presentations audience members somewhat control degree interaction people around also free look around room see people reacting particular parts talk chat others head back offices addition noticed participants sometimes behaved ways appropriate smaller groups apparently audience list subtle indication group size 1 example sometimes people raised hands middle point called said oh testing interface another time speaker already moved asking poll question audience member asked speaker repeat question distracted asked fact found tone talk seemed influenced type talk size group lecturestyle presentations small audience tended formal discussionstyle presentations large audience finally anticipated frequently people going watch groups around one persons desktop initially prototype ran one version operating system people running

something offensive someone listed attendee asymmetric roles many synchronous collaborative activities supported cscw tools participants play equivalent roles however nature presentations speaker audience play different roles asymmetry means tool cannot designed strictly according see see wysiwis principle stefik 1986 1987 tools designed using principle help users interpret going interaction enhance participants ability jointly learn use application tools designed support presentations must provide different capabilities speaker audience important create environments similar possible effectiveness creating shared environment designing forum attempted create shared environment making overall layout controls similar possible using controls time speaker audience shared functionality

continuous voiceactivated audio audience encountered certain technical problems unable eliminate audio echo obvious determine sounds audience appropriate transmit make sure expressions gestures came intended said even used assure looked presentable didnt smudges face limitations creating shared environment despite efforts design forum ways asymmetry situation user interfaces caused collaboration problems particular asymmetry made difficult participants jointly learn use forum number ways particularly difficult help others troubleshoot problems difficult learn fact asymmetry speakers audiences uis created doubt users minds aspects shared uncommon new users wonder aloud whether speaker audience members could see example first using poll users wondered whether speaker could tell voting option see figures 1 4 poll meter everyones interface audience members could certain uncertainty could affect behavior since might vote differently thought vote anonymous users wondered whether speaker entire audience could see written questions sent even though never saw anyone elses written questions times audience members sent written comments never acknowledged speaker users discon certed didnt know whether ignored technology hadnt worked one person put comments disappeared black hole far tell interesting cases audience members confused others saw view equivalent everyone elses interesting problem indicates notion wysiwis broken users doubt whether aspect interface shared among partici pants enough provide similar views one must also provide cues indicate aspects users views shared hand least one way asymmetry useful learning participating audience member forum talks users could potentially learn give talks well adapted forums environment speakers audience members realized effectiveness poll instance used regularly talks one speaker said annoyed speakers covered parts slides pointer tried avoid interest ing however even experienced audience members knew first hand useful split attention watching talk still found disconcerting speakers audience didnt appear paying full attention apparently knowledge didnt override need audience feedback difficult troubleshoot one frustrating aspects using forum trying help someone trouble symmetric applications small group use manage problem enabling everyone see everyone else shared drawing editing tool instance might show everyones cursor users ui controls well actually drawing writing min neman bly 1991 enables everyone see someone trouble manipulating ui offer step person task however everyone shares ui possible practical show activities hundred users also less appropriate large group setting stop focusing subject matter help one person carry task common problem arose using forum audience member wasnt able speak earlier version speaking interface turned relatively difficult audience members use design caused certain common errors times audience members attempts speak foiled technical problems microphone wasnt plugged battery dead buggy software tests designed part help debug software speaking interface also happened one part ui differed speaker audience mentioned speaker take action speak audience members hold button speak expected required get queue indicate wanted floor user called speaker didnt reply difficult speaker help couldnt step process couldnt see audience interface even could seen still wouldnt able see particular user problems way know trouble manipulating ui microphone wasnt turned observing participants struggling troubleshooting problems felt limited things could reduce occurrence start familiarized speakers audience interface hadnt experienced audience member added message capability found effective way audience members give help someones audio level set high appeared trying speak another audience member could send suggestions person rather bothering rest audience advice ultimately however best thing could modify interface make easier use fewer problems

experience building testing forum made much vivid us critically success presentation depend speakers ability gauge audiences ongoing reactions audi ences ability build upon others participation although forum quite successful enabling interesting rewarding distributed presentations effectiveness seemed highly dependent particular topic speaker particular forum effective either topic sparked great deal audience participation purpose talk simply provide information wide audience topic controversial audience members tended contribute frequently gave speaker feedback audiences reaction also prompted audience members react others contributions types talks tended satisfying speaker audience lecturestyle talks speakers communicated message audience included people might able willing attend facetoface talk forum enabled speaker reach wider audience would facetoface talk enabled audience learn information would missed required invest time effort attend speakers point view forum clearly less effective talks depended certain degree interaction controversial enough generate strong audience participation lack feedback made speakers feel like giant black box one speaker put likely blame provoking interest interesting even cases audience members far less likely dissatisfied however cost attending low usually learned least useful information even inspire ask questions hand audiences point view forums environment ways less limited facetoface setting primarily politeness rules audience relaxed forum longer rude work lis tening send notes audience members even leave middle presentation effect forum provided audiences opportunity get time spent presentation especially mildly interested topic course change affected atmosphere presentations putting pressure speakers reach interaction fact forum limited environment facetoface settings mean kind technology pursued fact think forum represents step beyond many distance learning technologies provides support realtime spontaneous interaction among speaker audience members still findings indicate distributed presentations must treated different kind presentation environment speakers must consider whether goals giving talk met less interactive setting cases wide distribution important factor example reduced feedback may acceptable price pay time expect new conventions develop proper behavior kind setting may help enhance speakers audiences experiences distributed presentations also worth exploring ways expand range situations distributed presentations effective indeed considered number approaches improving interactivity possible forum one approach change nature environment actually including local audience another improve upon technology design application future directions planning build specially equipped studio accommodate 35 local audience members remote audience would see video speaker local audience turn would see screen front room slides remote audience feedback attention paid providing adequate studio audio capabilities remote audience members hear local participants without requiring latter make special effort heard also exploring use input devices would enable speaker walk around interact screen rather standing front monitor using mouse technical course experiment simulated studio found raised number interesting issues one found students received talk mixed environment half forum half classroom performed worse final exam either classroomonly forum students believe result caused insufficient integration two audiences speaker found difficult attend audiences partly harder remote audience make presence felt partly certain aspects interface accentuated difference groups example speaker asked yesno question remote audience could answer yes local audience prompted response creating studio force us reconsider design forum match heterogenous environment aside building studio considering potential technology design enhancements forum since feedback audience speaker relatively impoverished one obvious enhancement would provide video audience although large group size would preclude showing everyone audience one could experiment matrix small slowly updating images similar portholes dourish bly 1992 currently users machines equipped cameras even transmitting much video data would probably overload networks however feasible experiment audio without waiting technology advancements noted technical problems echo varying audio levels compromised forcing audience members hold button speaking time speakers audio reduced lowered amount sound feeding back micro phone would worthwhile spend time improving audio spontaneous reactions willing audience members applause laugh ter could mixed transmitted group absence audio improvements also considered providing interface widget enable remote audience indicate amusement appreci ation reluctant simply put applause laughter buttons interface would require users take deliberate artificial actions indicate emotions usually conveyed spontaneously naturally however think worth experimenting different techniques information valuable speaker options increasing participant
