controlling functions transport layer typically designed failure behavior fixed networks mind example tcp flow control assumes loss tcp segment caused congestion problem therefore actions taken transport layer reduce congestion jac88 wireless environment explanation retransmission timer going usually different fixed networks tcp segment actually lost delayed lost due congestion rather transient disruption wireless link therefore recovery actions taken tcp may even decrease performance example tcp segments delayed retransmissions unnecessary since original packets get anyway soon radio link recovered moreover tcp segments lost due temporary distortion wireless link tcp take actions exponentially back retransmission timeout disappearance distortion wireless link immediately capable working full speed theory tcp congestion algorithm may even slow recovery ci94 however long radio link slow 9600 bps slowdown significant practice temporary disconnections radio link cause
