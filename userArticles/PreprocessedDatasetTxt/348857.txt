ontological approach information discovery internet databases internet solved ageold problem network connectivity thus enabling potential access data sharing among large numbers databases however enabling users discover useful information requires adequate metadata infrastructure must scale diversity dynamism users interests internet accessible databases paper present model partitions information space distributed highly specialized domain ontologies also introduce interontology relationships cater userbased interests across ontologies defined internet databases also describe architecture implements two fundamental constructs internet databases aim proposed model architecture eventually facilitate data discovery sharing internet databases b introduction emergence internet world wide web www among important developments computer industry particularly web brought wave new users service providers internet popular distributed information repository globalization also spurred development tools aids navigate share information corporate intranets previously accessible online prohibitive costs organizations world rely wide variety databases conduct everyday business databases usually designed scratch none found meet requirements led proliferation databases obeying different sets requirements modeling situations many stances lack organized conglomeration databases users create pieces information may exist current databases though may known certain piece information stored locating may prohibitive terms cost effort also renewed interest work done first third authors queensland university technology sharing information across heterogeneous platforms readily available relatively cheap network connectivity although one may potentially access participating databases reality almost intractable task due various fundamental problems challenge give user sense accessing single database contains almost everything needs allow effective efficient data sharing web need infrastructure support flexible tools information space organization communication facilities information discovery content description assembly data heterogeneous sources conversion data

ontology respect users refine queries browsing different classes ontology 32 interontology relationships user submits query local ontology might resolvable locally case system try find remote ontologies eventually resolve query order allow query migration interontology relationships dynamically established two ontologies based users needs interontology relationships viewed simplified way share information low overhead amount sharing interontology relationship typically involve minimum amount information exchange although relationships involve basically ontologies extended databases well allows flexibility organization querying information space interontology relationships three types see figure first type involves relationship two ontologies exchange information second type

interontology relationship two databases also involves providing general description information databases would like share third alternative relationship ontology database case database ontology
