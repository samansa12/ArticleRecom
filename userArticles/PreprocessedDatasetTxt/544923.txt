planning future situations complete state world certain time knowledge situation necessarily incomplete except simple cases like traditional blocks world planning systems also note situation might

action one situation produces new situation course generally know actual situation typically knowledge actions characterized statements precondition action true situation eect true situation resulting action note unlike standard situation calculus however take actions extended time allow complex simultaneous overlapping actions 33 recipes specication system behavior often called plan recipe 13 use

straightforward generally recipes capture complex learned behavior guide agent towards goal wide range possible conditions ranges possible results previous action work care specic form recipe insist
