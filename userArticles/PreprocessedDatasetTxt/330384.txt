also cannot linked client assume client subscribed service conduct transactions provided adequate identifying billing information eg credit card numbers protocols make use many basic ecash primitives generally simpler protocols using primitives common applications basic protocol allows customer sign unlimited use subscription service period time prevents service determining used service accessed time mechanisms provided make difficult customer share subscription others leaves vulnerable detection financial loss first set requirements protocols meet 31 requirements client privacy privacy clients protected specifically difficult vendor others link client particular requested transaction also difficult vendor link one transaction request thus building profile might ultimately tied client difficult service guarantee clients assured one steal service contracted ie vendors cannot tricked servicing invalid clients expense fraud prevention vendors assured providing un contracted services specifically active transaction requests service possible one time number paid subscriptions time 32 basic unlinkable serial protocol basic protocol two phases registration certificate redemption optionally followed termination phase goal registration issue credentials new subscriber new subscriber c presents sufficient identifying payment information vendor v vendor returns single blinded certificate authorizes client later execute single transaction service certificate redemption phase clients spend certificate execute transaction end certificate redemption phase vendor issues client another blinded certificate vendor cannot link new certificate spent one cannot use link transactions one another assume customer associated identifier c account whether identity actually known vendor may fact different identifiers different accounts use square braces indicate message authentication curly braces indicate message confidentiality thus x k might refer data x signed key k keyed hash x using k fxgk refers x encrypted key k purposes used refer mechanisms also provide message integrity use overlining indicate blinding eg x refers result blinding x use appropriate signature key 33 registration request certificate type signature key message 2 vendors signature key service used sign blinded hashes signed hash certificate service key also subject periodic renewal service keys published expiration times certificates used exchanged time see need verify structure blinded hashed nonce client substitutes anything inappropriate result invalid certificate message 1 creditauth credit authorization returned v subscription terminated 2 receive creditauth client must produce secret k audit creditauth held v event c fails audit audits described decision whether v actually draws credit policy decision outside scope paper vendor must remember sequence messages case message 2 received client see section 38 registration protocol protocol variants creditauth form deposit however traditional deposit sometimes undesirable since money held entire term service consider message 2 received period time space efficiency acknowledgement message may added customer may wish make use subscription multiple machines eg base machine home office laptop machine used traveling may considered much inconvenience require customer transport current unspent certificate subscriptions next likely platform use vendor may therefore allow customer obtain number initial certificates possibly additional fee nominal charge similarly customer might allowed add initial certificate subscription begins using new machine vendor need decide policy best meets needs kcv used link protocol messages one another becomes even important certificates redeemed transactions discuss assumptions requirements regarding linking presenting certificate redemption protocol 34 certificate redemption customer wants make use service conducts certificate redemption protocol v certificate redemption consists certificate spending transaction execution certificate renewal request transaction type shn message 3 c transaction message 3 done message 2 approved kcv two possibilities discussed next sections delay release new certificate hn i1 transaction ends prevent client beginning new certificate redemption protocol current one completes new certificate released transaction subscriber could run subscription server would proxy transactions clients kcv key used protect integrity session c choose unique session kcv compromised used later session attacker could create second field first message could hijack subscription uniqueness kcv thus important honest customers session integrity important vendor well vendor would like sure transaction queries processed connection legitimate certificate renewal unfortunately kcv may enough guarantee integrity protocol session one customers might intentionally reuse session key share others anyone key could submit queries integrity protected long query submitted active legitimate session session key nothing protocol distinguishes query legitimate queries would allow wide sharing subscriptions effectively bypassing certificate spend ing aspects protocol implementation might prevent explicit assume uses kcv somehow rendered serial within protocol run example kcv might used protocol stream cipher alternatively kcv might used secret nonce hashed plaintext plaintext hash sent message time message sent nonce could incremented something done make use kcv protocol session unique tied previous uses within run sharing subscriptions method becomes least inconvenient sharing passing unspent certificate around make assumption protocols mentioned paper use session key protect integrity session registration protocol vendor must remember messages sent protocol except transaction messages case client never received new blinded certificate efficiency acknowledgement message may added 35 approved response message 2 approved protocol terminates response request service might approved number reasons include certificate spent already nonce match submitted certificate certificate valid service requested alternatively certificate submitted might use expired key client valid subscriber never received initial certificate current key reflected vendors records client get initial certificate usual manner offline appeal necessary clients feel refused legitimate transaction request designed protocols assumption appeals automatically decided favor client long client appealed many times 36 audit response audit special audit occurs c must present proof valid subscriber within short period time particular c must prove knowledge k audit sent v registration satisfactory new certificate issued satisfactory c comply protocol terminates certificate logged along note used failed audit either case transaction takes place audited customers linked specific transaction requests main purpose audits serve secondary deterrent sharing subscription nonsubscriber primary deterrent inconvenience passing certificate back forth sharing compared cost obtaining another subscription see anyone demonstrate knowledge k audit provides valid certificate terminate corresponding subscription vendor transfer creditauth thus c want share k audit anyone trust redeem creditauth customer ever caught audit given away certificate k audit effectively forfeits subscription creditauth certificate never used new certificate issued continue subscription offline appeal mechanisms may available customers example lose certificates secret nonces audit protocol follows request transaction type shn similarly basic certificate redemption protocol message 4 fnot approvedgcv protocol terminates unlike basic certificate redemption protocol transaction phase direct link identifying information revealed audit particular transaction however exercising audit check frequently strategic times vendor learn clients usage frequency patterns might allow vendor correlate later transactions possibly earlier trans actions particular client client might counter limitation employing masking scheme top basic protocol however considerably increase load subscription service clients might also counter vendor analysis delaying ordinary transaction requests random amount time following audit places extra burden subscription service may cause customers inconvenience substantially beyond audits since audits secondary deterrent abuse might conducted infrequently tradeoffs threats anonymity deterrence effect subscription sharing difficult assess priori thus exactly frequent make audits currently difficult say service must remember sequence messages run protocol case broken connection messages may remembered associated key expires amount time elapsed new certificate assumed received efficiency acknowledgement message may added see next section customers want protect k audit message 3 audit protocol explicitly use kcv encryption key cases encrypted vendor using v practice symmetric would typically used favor computationally expensive public key v however essential v used message 3 since would allow subscriber share subscription produce responses audit challenges without revealing secret k audit shared 37 terminating subscription client initiated termination subscription variant certificate redemp tion however trigger audit termination requires client prove knows k audit unspent certificate termination effect passing creditauth subscriber v passes creditauth one time request transaction type terminationc kcv refunds may prorated based vendors policy early termina tion subscription include multiple chains certificates eg workstation laptop one creditauth per chain message 2 encrypt using kcv since require client possess private key acknowledgement message may added efficiency 38 recovering broken connections protocols break vendor receives acknowledgement must replayed entirety except actual transaction always skipped session key nonce blinding factor protocols designed release new information replayed broken protocols considered automatically acknowledged period time ie customer much time recover broken connection period time longer replayed crucial redemption protocol crucial registration protocol period time subscription may charged consider connection breaks occurring end protocol beginning connection breaks new certificate acknowledged message 5 certificate redemption protocol client simply initiate new transaction new certificate connection breaks c receives message 4 v receives message 5 client simply initiate new transaction point protocol client yet received new certificate recovering connection breaks occur prior point protocol involve replaying protocol vendor keep record protocol run receives acknowledgement message 5 upon replay client presents sequence messages vendor identify presented certificate spent consult recovery database protocol recoverable ie yet acknowledged vendor returns stored response response message 2 audit v keep record protocol run even c properly identifies upon reestablishing connection may cheater broke connection quickly notified legitimate client audit client breaks audit protocol repeatedly vendor may become suspicious may decide renew certificate notice customer need never identify broken connection occurs unless audit already stipulated vendor thus need worry associated given transaction another kind failure affects system disk crash media failure unrealistic unreasonable expect customers backup copies subscription information every time redeem certificate often unrealistic expect customers make backups therefore customers must allowed reinitialize subscription disk crash often individuals allowed reinitialize course subscription policy decision individual vendors another option provide customers distinct backup initial certificates registration may obtain initial certificates multiple machines allows recover disk crash without reregistering assuming kept backups separately however provide additional subscription chains cost one subscription 39 service key management unlinkable protocols work important service keys closely associated clients example want vendor able uniquely associate service key client would enable vendor associate transactions clients committing service keys straightforward technique overcome potential vulnerability requires vendor publicly commit public authorization keys achieved publishing information regular intervals unique location well known potential clients ser vice example publication format service consists service type expiration time signature confirmation key signatures associated service subscription termination general security precaution primary reason change service keys facilitate expiration subscriptions keys expire current mechanism clients obtain new certificates signing service initially service expiration structured several different ways advantages disadvan tages present briefly mention tradeoffs acceptable depend particular aspects application context purposes discussion let us assume standard period subscription one year divided months subscription expiry one option annualized keys start month words twelve valid service keys service times convenient customer similar existing subscription mechanisms however partitions using service twelve groups reducing anonymity customers accordingly may may problem subscriptions annualized quarters reduces threat anonymity might still unacceptable reduces customer flexibility subscriptions begin alternative monthly keys good subscribers subscribers obtain twelve seed certificates subscribe one use month succeeding year reduce anonymity last option hand requires customers keep track multiple certificates requires issuing certificates well advance period eligibility vendors perspective threat audit becomes much reduced since cheater lose current months certificate relatedly much easier share subscriptionat least monthly pieces thus inconvenience deterrent reduced slightly well another option subscriptions end month someone subscribing beginning fiscal year would pay prorated amount subscription avoids reductions anonymity associated monthly annualized keys also avoids reduced deterrence cheating associated monthly keys reduces customer flexibility choosing ending subscription another disadvantage approach subscription renewal concentrated one point year creating extremely unbalanced load part system handling sign newal would probably remain true even renewing customers allowed renew advance could diminished splitting year half even creates partitioning reduction anonymity already mentioned early termination subscription terminating subscription early requires proving user particular subscriber spending valid certificate get new one way continue using service notice early termination even customized ex ample available customers already subscribed least year recall customer reveals identity pseudonym terminates early prorating refunds terminated subscriptions removes one disadvantages third option subscription expiration described describing subscriber termination subscription vendor termination particular subscriber group far difficult may also less important current approach way terminate subscriber change service keys remainder subscription require everyone else reinitialize certificates new key creates tremendous expense inconvenience equivalent would necessary service key compromised 310 discussion protocols presented thus far limitations protecting defraud ing vendor organizing service share subscriptions seems doubtful practical solution exists fully protect attack given goal unlinkable transactions example subscriptions may shared subscriber runs subscription proxy server makes sharing centralized activity attendant complexity running new business business overhead complexity marketing advertising maintaining service reliability perhaps importantly potential disadvantage focus legal attention finally vendor take action particular shared account shows frequently audit registered subscriber running subscription proxy service lending unspent certificate done make sharing cen tralized addition mechanisms already place key require intimate contact lender borrower sharing inherently risky lender borrower may never return subscription thus lender require deposit however requiring deposit charging fraudulent activity historically key element detecting limiting fraud another approach forces lending centralized complements approach presented design protocol borrower must contact lender every transaction lender want share secrets currently borrower needs contact lender audited get k audit alternatively one could modify protocol require k audit indirectly present first message every run certificate redemption protocol example
