original section 7 elaborates overhearing enrich functionality oered auctioning system conceptually english auction protocol described follows auctioneer seeks nd market price object initially proposing price supposed market value gradually raising time price announced auctioneer waits see buyer signals willingness pay proposed price soon one buyer indicates interest auctioneer issues new call bids incremented price auction continues nobody willing buy point auction ends auctioneer decides whether sell depending nal accepted price round auction fipa prescribes auctioneer rst sends callforproposal message cfp act fipa terminology proposed price participant ie potential buyer everybody interested sends back propose message declaring bid nally moving next round auctioneer replies propose specifying whether participants bid accepted since fipa assumes pointtopoint communication auctioneer identify potential participants beforehand keep informed state bid latter requirement arises participant needs know competing someone else ideally even one competing may important competitive scenario order decide whether necessary increase bid win auction using channeled multicast oers two main opportunities rst reducing total eort including number mes second increasing social awareness auc tions progress indeed auctioneer starts pro cess assume everybody potentially interested tuned channel participants placed bids know everybody knows many competitors involved auction course channeled multicast alone cannot guarantee common knowledge dened 13 ie perfect distribution infor mation however protocol describe meant approximate common knowledge practical engineering purposes importantly twophase termination closely mimics human auctions signi cantly reduces chances uncorrect termination due lost messages protocol prescribes round auc tion auctioneer sends single callforbid message channel call contains proposed price well name winner previous round normally rst participant submit bid everybody updated current situation auction receiving call participant propose bid current price replying channel auctioneer waits receive bid proposals partic ipants least two bids received means competition among participants auctioneer sends new callforbid higher price bids previous price arrive late simply ignored one bid received within certain amount time auctioneer resends callforbid waits reason repetition prevent wrong termination auction due loss messages either auctioneer participant probability missing message round p twophase termination process reduces probability p 2 end second phase still nobody one participant sent bid auction ends auctioneer announces winner one bidding current round winner previous round none 2 overall protocol requires four types messages init auction sent auctioneer declare start auction give information item sold propose bid sent auctioneer current price winner previous round nobody rst accept bid sent participant
