data many concerns video eg modeling querying also found databases databases provide interesting angle attack many problems video applications perspective database systems provide nice basis future video systems generally database research provide solutions many video issues even partial fragmented database perspective video applications provide beautiful challenges next generation database systems need provide support multimedia data eg image video audio data types require new techniques management ie storing modeling querying etc hence new solutions significant paper develops data
