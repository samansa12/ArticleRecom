issues bargained ordering called negotiation agenda moreover one factors determines outcome negotiation agenda 4 end two ways incorporating agendas negotiation model one fix agenda exogenously part negotiation procedure 4 way flexible allow bargainers decide issue negotiate next process negotiation called endogenous agenda 5 background paper presents multiissue negotiation model endogenous

presenting realistic negotiation model captures following three aspects many real life bargaining situations firstly model negotiating multiple issues secondly takes time constraints bargainers
