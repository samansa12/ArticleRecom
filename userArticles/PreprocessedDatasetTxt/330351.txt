managing process inconsistency using viewpoints abstractthis paper discusses notion process inconsistency suggests inconsistencies software processes inevitable sometimes desirable present approach process analysis helps discover different perceptions software process supports discovery process inconsistencies process improvements stimulated inconsistencies analogy viewpoints requirements engineering allow multiple perspectives software system specification managed developed notion process viewpoints provide multiperspective descriptions software processes process viewpoint includes statement focus worldview set sources process information process description set organizational concerns represent goals constraints process analysis present description rationale process viewpoints discuss process applying process viewpoints process understanding illustrate overall approach using part case study drawn industrial processes part safetycritical system development b introduction past years growing awareness organisations leverage significant productivity improvements improving business processes software development processes one class business process received particular attention since early 1980s significant body research software processes software process improvement developed roughly research split two main categories 1 fundamental research concerned process modelling enactment support technology involves developing notations representing processes looking automated support processes provided good summaries research area provided 1 2 2 research concerned process improvement introduction process changes improve software productivity quality etc related general work business process reengineering 3 although software process improvement programmes tend evolutionary rather revolutionary best known work area software engineering institute capability maturity model 4 5 related work maturity models process improvement also carried 6 large extent different aspects process rd parallel research streams fundamental process research really addressed issues research results applied facilitate change improvement process improvement work taken pragmatic approach process description dependent structured formal process notations proponents approach suggest automation central process improvements indeed sei model discourages automation early stages improvement developers maintain process enactment support costeffective disciplined repeatable process put place work describe paper falls somewhere areas research developed part pragmatic process improvement project specifically aimed discovering routes requirements engineering process improvement 8 however facilitate process elicitation analysis improvement decided needed structured framework managing process descriptions could cope different types process description furthermore reflected organisational goals process improvement studies requirements engineering processes previously types software process 9 revealed remarkable process inconsistency within across organisations inconsistencies processes necessarily mean process problems arise number good reasons 1 many tasks require software engineers exercise professional judgement experience different people may thing different ways may effective 2 different processes objectives may developed different parts organisation consequence local factors tool equipment availability management style etc 3 depending particular interests different people may focus different aspects process example quality manager may mostly concerned process activities affect product quality whereas project manager concerned scheduling resources used activities may selectively ignore parts process interest result inconsistent models process actually 4 processes vary depending type system developed participants process particularly true processes requirements engineering processes solely technical involve significant interaction customers others outside software development team primary goal work facilitate process understanding improvement needed way describing processes would allow us collect different perceptions process reconcile differences wanted understand different process perspectives view discovering best practice identify areas improvements seemed viable process inconsistencies particularly important two reasons areas inconsistency may suggest process redundancy activities unnecessary fully partially removing redundancy may lead process improvements areas inconsistency highlight particularly good practice different processes accomplishing goal evolved effective processes may selected widespread dissemination across organisation research process modelling notations 10 really taken potential process inconsistency account assumes single model process elicited agreed process participants however experience suggested difficult achieve many software processes processes seen different process participants stakeholders often inconsistent definitive model could produced process descriptions different participants could integrated combined description complex virtually impossible understand validate single notation process participants stakeholders familiar comfortable people wanted describe process way felt imposing perhaps formal notation would counterproductive believe lot said checklands rich pictures 11 processes described using representations meaningful people involved process consequently decided look single process representation allow process represented different ways reflecting different process perceptions process representation framework cope inconsistency support process improvement previous experience viewpoints requirements engineering 12 13 suggested viewpoints might appropriate framework encapsulating partial process knowledge decided adapt approach requirements viewpoints developed 14 process representation researchers come comparable conclusions experimented multiperspective approach process modelling earliest work aware work carried rombach late 1980s development mvpl 15 process modelling language

turgeon madhavji 18 also developed multiview approach elicitation automated consistency checking based work process elicitation methodological tool support developed 19 20 previous work managing process inconsistencies across viewpoints mostly derived comparable work viewpointoriented software engineering relies automatic semiautomatic analysis formal process descriptions discover inconsistencies across descriptions 21 followed path found practitioners interested learning formal process representation languages furthermore complexity subtlety real processes made almost impossible produce formal process descriptions understandable people involved process rather focused developing framework associated process facilitates elicitation process analysis people rather
