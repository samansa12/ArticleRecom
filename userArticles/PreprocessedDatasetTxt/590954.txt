maximum confidence policy one step minimum expected cost policy reduce minimax interval policy also sufficiently small transition probabilities p 1 maximum likelihood policy agree minimax interval policy follows expect difference mentioned policies case varying probabilities costs first example illustrates difference various surveillance strategies introduced far example 51 consider environment set consisting two rooms 08 strategy based maximum likelihood always look room x 1 uncertainty maximal never take look room x 2 strategy based methodical exploration goes back forth rooms maximum confidence policy strategy based one step minimising expected cost slightly complicated 08 since room x 2 visited immediately preceding time step however p increased 075 enough get chosen time 3 p increased 08 probability relevant event occurs room 2 thus obtain sequence room x 1 chosen every third time step see table 1 first six time steps expected costs visiting room displayed one step minimum expected cost policy chooses room maximal expected cost printed boldface table 1 expected costs example 51 example maximum likelihood policy result exhaustive exploration environment maximum confidence minimum expected cost behave better respect problem maximum likelihood criterion p x guaranteed result preference visit x rather x fact p x criterion prefers x j notice artificial example also practical applications sufficiently many locations sufficiently high transition probabilities happen p x since maximum likelihood criterion prefer locations chance detecting relevant event high interested locations occurrence relevant event highly unknown conclude criterion appropriate symmetrical surveillance asymmetrical surveillance example 51 one step minimum expected cost policy results behaviour seems intuitively appealing since clearly reflects fact p x substantially lower p confidence methodical exploration treats rooms however see intuitive appeal may somewhat misleading maximum confidence policy also take probabilities p account since rate confidence decrease function probabilities however decrease rate proposed 3 result different treatment rooms example thus one view

may difference performance example early detection considered important table 2 expected costs example 52 following simple modification example 51 shows general proposition 52 longer valid one step minimum expected cost policy longer guaranteed result exhausite exploration environment costs allowed vary example 52 consider situation example 51 assume cx 1 3 expected cost visiting room 1 upper bound 1 whereas expected visiting room 2 24 even visited previous moment therefore one step minimum expected cost policy room 2 always chosen see table 2 first four time steps expected costs visiting room displayed one step minimum expected cost policy chooses room maximal expected cost printed boldface effect ignoring room 1 avoided allowing cost detecting event grow function time passed since event started however mentioned expected costs correct ignoring room 1 may defensible intuitively one require surveillance agent explore irrelevant unimportant areas environment substantiated following proposition 53 environment example 52 one step minimum expected cost policy minimises global expected cost perhaps important problem possibly preventing exhaustive exploration environment varying cost form obstacle obtaining optimal behaviour using local one step mimimum expected cost policy example 53 consider environment set consisting three rooms example 52 one step minimum expected cost policy always choose room 2 possibly justifiable ignoring room 1 make impossible visit room 0 long run expected cost visiting room 0 high obviously problems solved theoretically looking one step ahead since looking ahead many steps computationally expensive would useful develop methods assessing number steps required obtain satisfactory behaviour even constant costs one step minimum expected cost policy guaranteed globally minimise expected cost proposition 54 environment example 51 one step minimum expected cost policy minimise global expected cost actually example 51 global expected
