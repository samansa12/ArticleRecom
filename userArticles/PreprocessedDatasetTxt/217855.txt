experiments used help choose datafeature mapping dynamically displaying slice data users trying detect target elements find track regions interest encoded using hue secondary information displayed using different forms eg circles squares 7 conclusions future work results work provide number guidelines use hue form realtime visualization hue used perform rapid accurate boundary target detection form used perform boundary detection cannot used readily perform target detection secondary data dimension encoded hue user wants perform realtime multidimensional visualization hue used encode primary data dimension investigated secondary data dimensions encoded form interfere boundary target detection tasks performed using hue multidimensional data often contains two data values encoded spatial location shown tools support visualization multiple data dimensions must deal potential interaction features used represent dimensions rather trying avoid sometimes control interaction use advantage example pickett grinstein used texture represent highdimensional data dimension controls one aspect texture element displayed user another promising avenue investigation involves emergent features careful choice simple features allow absent present hot cold figure 15 example output salmon tracking simulations salmon hot ocean regions displayed emergent feature closure detected since three background objects use closure target element region similar data elements detected preattentively pomerantz pristach 1989 thereby signalling correlation variables data figure 15 shows one possible example technique salmon tracking simulations discribed section 61 scientists search salmon entering hot ocean regions correlation hot present combines form emergent feature closure since

potential method representing multivalued dimension divide visual feature space two unique values research preattentive processing already studied aspects problem example easy detect tilted rectangle

divisible four categories steep flat left right wolfe et al 1992 another example division hue feature space experiments studied effect dividing hue multiple values target used hue could separated distractors straight line colour space detection rapid accurate however target used hue collinear space distractors detection significantly difficult dzmura 1991 suggests hue feature space divided multiple values target targets must linearly separable distractors plan study effects context visualization environment number important extensions would like pursue related specifically realtime
