interface data architecture query preview networked information systems numerous problems associated formulating queries networked information systems include increased data volume complexity accompanied slow network access article proposes new approach network query user interfaces consists two phases query preview query refinement new approach based concepts dynamic queries query

skillful reasoning browsing strategies require less knowledge difficult volume data large keywordoriented formbased interfaces widely used formulating queries networked information systems often generate zerohit queries query results contain large number results users must browse users limit many results query returns eg 20 limit duration search impossible estimate much data returned representative entire search space results users also often fail find data appropriate keywords cannot guessed query previews combine browsing querying summary data number records attribute value guide users narrow scope queries summary data varies database application provides overview database several perspectives generally orders magnitude smaller database downloaded quickly drive dynamic query interface locally users machine therefore query previews support dynamic query user interface visual display summary updated real time response users selections users rapidly reduce number

restaurant finder designed help users identify restaurants match certain criteria users first specify criteria restaurants want type food price range reduces number selected restaurants manageable
