two children suffice purposes individual node comprises template shown figure 2 basic template denoted h basic may viewed 3 3 grid vertices row column grid induce 3clique vertices first column template referred ground vertices fact shared across templates treestructures since ground vertices form clique legal coloring assign three distinct colors refer colors 1 2 3 connection pattern

templates ip v ip ip1 via appropriate edges nodes schematic labeled 3tuples form hxyzi x 3g edges shown various vertices given simple rule two vertices adjacent labels differ three coordinates 221 node selection node tree called selected least one three rows template colors reading left right form even permutation f1 2 3g ie first row colors 123 second one 231 third one 312 similarly say row selected least one three rows template colors reading left right form odd permutation easy see legal 4coloring node never simultaneously labeled selected well selected moreover 4coloring node always either selected selected 222 enforcing selection leaf node goal enforce legal 4coloring treestructure least one leaf node selected broadly speaking approach hardwire selection root node introduce

easier present root selection tree 1 r enforce selection root using gadget shown figure 4 obtained adding j 2 f1 2 3g edges ground vertex colored j first vertex row number j mod 3 1 copy h basic root node r ensures 4coloring h one row root selected hence root selected indeed must exist one row whose vertices colored using 4 say concreteness third row since added edge ground vertex colored 2 first vertex third row vertex cannot colored 2 follows third row root must colored 3 1 2 desired propagating selection next show selection node tree propagated least one children ensures tree least one leaf node must selected consider schematic figure 3 assign following interpretation node labels colors first coordinate node correspond situation ij selected enforces selection v ij colors second coordinate node correspond situation ij selected enforces selection ij1 colors third coordinate node correspond situation ij selected enforce selection children easy verify l 2 f1 2 3g assign colors 1

f2 3 1g f3 1 2g remaining nodes selected ie coloring three rows corresponding templates f1 3 2g f2 f3 2 1g yields legal 3coloring following thus evident construction lemma 21 1 r 8j 0 j k 3coloring vertices treestructure leaf corresponding v ij selected leaf establish following key lemma lemma 22 4coloring tree whenever internal node selected one two children must selected proof consider schematic figure 3 p parent whose selection want argue implies selection one children l r consider two cases case 1 vertices one pairs fh112i h113ig fh221i h223ig fh331i h332ig receive color 4 4coloring h suppose pair fh331i h332ig receives color 4 since p selected third row p must colored 3 1 2 case claim one l r fact selected third row colored 3 1 2 indeed none vertices h122i h211i h212i h121i third row nonground vertices l r get color 4 adjacent one h331i h332i thus neither l r selected h122i h212i get colored 2 h211i h121i get colored 1 easy see vertices h123i h231i h312i color 1 well color neighbors instance h123i adjacent h211i h212i implies three must colored either 3 4 impossible three vertices form clique thus one l r must selected exactly similar arguments hold vertices h112i h113i receive color 4 vertices h221i h223i receive color 4 remains consider following case case 2 one vertices pairs fh112i h113ig fh221i h223ig fh331i h332ig receives color 4 4coloring h case first claim least one vertices h112i h113i gets colored 1 one h221i h223i gets colored 2 one h331i h332i gets colored 3 see note p selected may assume without loss generality third row p colored 3 1 2 thus claim trivially verified colors 1 2 since h112i colored 1 h221i colored 2 neither h331i h332i colored 3 fact must colored 4 since instance h332i cannot colored either 1 2 since adjacent h111i h221i respectively contradicts hypothesis case therefore claim holds ready finish proof case 2 also suppose p selected neither l r selected call row node pure none vertices colored 4 clearly least one rows l r pure since entire gadget totally symmetric assume definiteness third row l pure colored 3 2 1 recall l selected cannot colored 3 1 2 third row r pure also colored 3 2 1 get contradiction exactly obtained analysis case 1 one first second rows r pure say without loss generality first row r pure colored 1 3 2 upshot vertices h122i h211i h323i h322i receive colors 2 consider vertex h231i adjacent among vertices h122i colored 2 h323i colored 3 h112i h113i one colored 1 claim 1 follows therefore h231i colored 4 exactly similar argument shows h123i must also colored 4 indeed h123i adjacent h211i colored 1 h322i colored 2 one colored 3 claim 1 h231i h123i colored 4 adjacent contradiction completes analysis case 2 well proof complete c figure 5 leaflevel gadget row kind2 figure
