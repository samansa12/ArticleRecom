using web structure classifying describing web pages structure web increasingly used improve organization search analysis information web example google uses text citing documents documents link target document search analyze relative utility document text text citing documents near citation classification description results show text citing documents available often greater discriminative descriptive power text target document combination evidence document citing documents improve either information source alone moreover ranking words phrases citing documents according expected entropy loss able accurately name clusters web pages even positive examples results confirm quantify extend previous research using web structure areas introducing new methods classification description pages b introduction web large collection heterogeneous documents recent estimates predict size indexable web 4 billion pages web pages unlike standard text collections contain multimedia images sounds flash etc connections documents hyperlinks hyperlinks increasingly used improve ability organize search analyze web hyperlinks citations actively used improve web search engine ranking 4 improve web

citation link analysis link often created subjective connection original document cited linked document example making web page hobbies like playing scrabble might link online scrabble game home page hasbro belief connections convey meaning judgments made creator link citation web hyperlink two components destination page associated anchortext describing link page creator determines anchortext associated link example user could create link pointing hasbros home page user could define associated anchortext favorite board games home page personal nature anchortext allows connecting words destination pages shown figure 1 anchortext utilized way search engine google improve web search google allows pages returned based keywords occurring inbound anchortext even words dont occur page returning httpwwwyahoocom query web directory typical textbased classification methods utilize words phrases target document considering significant features underlying assumption page contents effectively describe page classified unfortunately often web page might contain obvious clues textually intent example home page microsoft corporation httpwwwmicrosoftcom provides mention fact sell operating systems home page general motors http wwwgmcomflashhomepage state car company except word motors title word automotive inside form field make matters worse like majority web pages general motors home page meaningful metatags 15 determining particular page belongs given class even though page obvious clues words capture higherlevel notion challenge ie gm car manufacturer microsoft designs sells operating systems yahoo directory service anchortext since decided people interested page may better summarize contents page indicating yahoo web directory excitehome internet service

directories manually created judgments page goes done human exam ple yahoo puts general motors several categories auto makers parts automotive b2b auto parts automotive dealers yahoo puts yahoo several categories including web homepage httpwwwhomecomindex flashhtml text metatags textbrowser lynx rendered page blank directories unfortunately large web directories difficult manually maintain may slow include new pages therefore desirable able learn automatic classifier tests membership given category unfortunately makeup given category may arbitrary example yahoo decided anthropology archaeology grouped together social sciences open directory project dmoz separated archaeology category also social sciences second problem initially category may defined small number pages classification may difficult third problem naming category example given ten random botany pages would know category named botany related biology two six random pages selected yahoo category botany

usefulness individual feature approach assigns low scores features although common sets unlikely useful binary classifier one limitations using approach inability consider cooccurrence features two features individually may useful combined may become highly effective coetzee et al discuss optimal method feature selection 7 method although optimal run constant time per feature constant memory per feature plus final sort 3 significantly less optimal method described coetzee perform several things reduce effects possible feature cooccurrence first consider words phrases three terms considering phrases reduces chance pair features missed example word molecular word biology individually may poor classifying page molecular biology phrase obviously useful second approach reducing problem consider many features relatively low threshold first step svm classifier able identify features important even individually 3 assume histogram required computation generated separately assume constant time look data feature histogram might result considering larger number features reduce chance feature incorrectly missed due low individual entropy experiments typically considered thousand features classifier easily handled svm set thresholds 7 positive negative sets 214 using entropy ranked features name clusters ranking features expected entropy loss information gain allows us
