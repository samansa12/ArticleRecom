characterization ecommerce traffic world wide web achieved immense popularity business world thus essential characterize traffic behavior sites study facilitate design development highperformance reliable ecommerce servers paper makes effort direction aggregated traffic arriving businesstobusiness b2b businesstoconsumer b2c ecommerce site collected analyzed high degree selfsimilarity found

introduction explosive popularity internet propelled usage several commercial avenues ecommerce usage internet buying selling products found major presence todays economy ecommerce sites provide uptodate information services products users businesses services ranging personalized shopping automated interaction corporations provided websites reported ecommerce sites generated 132 billion 2000 double 58 billion reported 1999 1 even though power servers hosting ecommerce sites increasing ecommerce sites unable improve level service provided users reported around 420 million lost revenues due slow processing transactions 1999 thus desirable necessary focus performance servers used environments two main classes ecommerce sites businesstobusiness b2b businesstoconsumer b2c providing services corporations individual users respectively web sites like delphi provide services corporations like general motors come b2b sites whereas sites like amazoncom providing services general users come b2c

study system characteristics collected system logs ecommerce sites 3 ecommerce architecture generic organization ecommerce sites depicted figure 1 ecommerce sites broadly classified two different categories business business b2b business consumer b2c main difference two categories sites lies user population accessing sites b2b sites serve transactions different businesses whereas b2c sites serve general users internet internet users edge router isp provider cache mcs load balancer web servers firewall database servers frontend backend figure 1 generic ecommerce site businesstobusiness one main characteristics category sites regularity arrival traffic observed heavy traffic comes 9am 5pm normal business hours regularity imply lack heavy spikes traffic sustained peak load system either due seasonal effects due availability different services site sites categorized high amount buying taking place observed percentage transactions resulting buying high compared b2c environment businesstoconsumer b2c servers normal ecommerce sites user get service security involved b2c site restricted financial transactions involved whereas b2b environment transactions normally done secure mode one implication increased buying b2c environment throttle system since designed system expect high percentage buy transactions another important characteristic b2c site low tolerance delayed responses increases need make qos important providing absolute security transactions hence security reserved transactions involving buying 31 frontend backend servers typically frontend servers
