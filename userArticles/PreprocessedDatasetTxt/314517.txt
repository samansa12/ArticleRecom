optimum costs two databases 5 multiple brokers far assumed single broker knows databases question information system aims covering information sources reached via network assumption realistic reason consider case multiple brokers broker knows databases andor brokers reasonable extension decisiontheoretic approach would development procedure allowing broker decide whether contact another broker processing specific query two possibilities representing metaknowledge another broker b broker 1 treat b like database thus typical broker would represent large database general case poses obvious difficulties cost estimation since broker stands number databases different costs modelling broker costs approximation real costs especially several databases used processing query approximation may totally wrong however even query processing costs equal costs per document databases broker b still cannot make proper estimate costs would caused sending query broker b reason applying equation 3 estimating costs sum r denotes number relevant documents retrieved database cannot expressed function sums 2 use detailed metaknowledge b b keeps sum probabilistic weights ie weights v j appendix query condition database knowledge databases b modelled distribution v j assuming normal distribution distribution represented pair mean variance let possess knowledge b given information conditions linear query distribution numbers relevant documents wrt whole query normal distribution thus could estimate probability specific database known b least r relevant documents knowing total number databases managed b also estimate probability least one database r documents however actually need expected cost ec r n retrieving n relevant documents via b comparing estimates corresponding figures databases would yield optimum solution even simplified cost assumptions would sum probabilities possible cases practical cases considerations follows approach cannot used deciding whether contact another broker processing current query would use heuristic criteria decision purpose could use number relevant documents accessed via broker b figure estimated methods mentioned latter also gives us variance thus could decide access b case number relevant documents exceeds specific threshold certain probability assume decision procedure determines brokers access achieve optimum selection databases case clue solution problem lies divideandconquer algorithm described section 4 let us assume different brokers access disjoint sets databases perform divide step according broker structure thus broker contacts brokers b c b c first determine local optimum cost functions c r n send back two functions could also add additional overhead costs invoking another broker treated way local databases order arrive global optimum thus specific number relevant documents determines many documents requested b c turn split requests local databases course whole procedure invoked recursively case b c also contact brokers order apply procedure case databases may served one broker devise communication structure considers database important determining optimum cost function also plays role estimating number relevant documents accessible via certain broker first let us assume two brokers know also synchronize metaknowledge databases overlapping metaknowledge referring databases brokers passes information nonoverlapping sources however local strategy able avoid overlapping pair brokers since may linked indirectly knowledge source task determining optimum cost function problem solved dynamically following way broker b sends local optimum function back requesting broker appends identifications databases involved optimum solution thus able detect duplicate databases request revised cost function without specific databases addition b also could store information order considered future requests assuming always calls set brokers brokers never drop database finally metaknowledge propagation also raises issue maximum propagation distance pair related brokers b metaknowledge everything b knows broker metaknowledge sources reached directly indirectly hand means knowledge new database propagated brokers world one possible strategy overcoming situation might broker pass metaknowledge brokers 6 related work gloss system described gravano et al 94 gravano garciamolina 95
