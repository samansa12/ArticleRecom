customer retention must decomposed several subproblems knowledge derived task one phase serve input next phase since available data mining techniques tools designed taskspecific according framework given figure 1 rather problemspecific cannot applied directly solve realworld problems many challenges found realworld applications changing environment cause data fluctuate make previously discovered patterns partially invalid phenomenon termed concept drift widmer 1996 possible solutions include incremental methods updating patterns treating drifts opportunity interesting discovery using cue search patterns change matheus et al 1994 practice often find many organizations collecting data byproduct business process hence large databases hundreds tables millions records multigigabytes size quite commonplace analysis selection discretization extraction tree network discovery association classification clustering deviation statistical analysis preprocessing summarization visualization category task approach tools methods techniques framework data mining type multipurpose system figure 1 framework classification data mining tools tasks many application domains case companys databases typically logged 45000 transactions per day months database alone easily aggregate gigabytes data without even including many operational databases aggravate matter databases high dimensionality large number fields attributes results exponential increase size search space hence intolerably long computational time required running machine learning algorithms resolve problems need preprocess data set reduce dimensionality problem another practical issue concepts various levels abstraction taxonomies reason knowledge patterns various characteristics however transactional operational databases usually described terms lowlevel concepts relations like freight car companies cognitively distant highlevel business concepts required decision making like loyal customers since generality knowledge needed determine interestingness applicability practical problems forms generalization specialization must catered work focus mainly challenges immediate need customer retention obviously also many challenges practical data mining applications fayyad et al 1996 include challenges like understandability patterns complex relationships fields missing noisy data data overfitting forth another point cannot stressed enough data mining application requires substantial much knowhow skills experiences user often fully understood many thus leading failures data mining applications

retention data mining application motivation work comes fact problem customer retention becoming increasingly pressing issue organizations 6in sales eg departmental stores banking insurance etc services eg providers internet andor telecommunications services related industries economic point view customer retention directly translates huge saving marketing costs highlighted coopers lybrand vince bowey lot companies figured costs acquire new customer usually pretty shocking estimate costs three five times money acquire new customer keep ones problem especially important organizations small customer base customer represents group large number companies defection single customer means significant percentage loss revenue company naturally company strong interest retain every one especially important company facing keen competition many upcoming relayers neighboring countries increased competitiveness means marketing division facing higher risk customer defection potentially escalates marketing costs due defections furthermore relaying activities entrepot nature ie intermediary center call transfer repackaging conference call hence defection customer another relayer likely influence associated business alliances also defect order maintain already established business relationship thus possibility snowball effect defection gives rise pressing need effective method identify less obvious associations customers benefit marketing customer retention finally contrary popular belief focusing retaining customers passive policy existing customers often bring new customers business associations expansion well word mouth despite importance customer retention problem many organizations simply cannot anything since customers free leave without warning dissatisfied services better offers come fortunately case relaying business offering attractive discount rebate schemes customers especially major senders consortiums groups company usually least secure shortterm contractual agreements means potential defectors cannot pull abruptly moreover customers usually committed sheer size regular relaying transactions company must prescheduled time eg weeks months advance hence potential defectors take couple months gradually trimout outgoing volumes relaying business eventual withdrawal gradual pulling process offers company opportunity identify signals defection predict possible chaineffect defec tion early warnings like give marketing department ample leadtime investigate causes take rectification actions defections actually take place
