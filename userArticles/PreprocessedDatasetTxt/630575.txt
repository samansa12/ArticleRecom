analyzing subjective interestingness association rules association rules class important regularities databases found useful practical applications however association rule mining algorithms tend produce huge number rules interest user due large number rules difficult user analyze manually identify truly interesting ones article presents new approach assist user finding interesting rules particular unexpected rules set discovered association rules technique characterized analyzing discovered association rules using users existing knowledge domain ranking discovered rules according various interestingness criteria eg conformity various types unexpectedness technique implemented successfully used number applications b introduction interestingness issue long identified important problem data mining refers finding rules interestinguseful user possible rule eg 1 11 12 21 23 24 27 30 reason importance practice easy data mining algorithm discover glut rules rules interest user 11 12 21 27 30 particularly true association rule mining eg 2 3 7 14 16 28 often produces huge number rules huge number rules makes manual inspection rules difficult automated assistance needed paper presents interestingness analysis system ias help user identify interesting association rules 11 rule interestingness measures past research data mining shown interestingness rule measured using objective measures subjective measures eg 27 11 objective measures involve analyzing rules structure predictive performance statistical significance eg 27 21 17 14 2 3 association rule mining measures include support confidence 2 28 3 however noted 21 objective measures insufficient determining interestingness discovered appear ieee intellgent systems 2000 rule subjective measures needed subjective interestingenss topic paper two main subjective interestingness measures unexpectedness 11 27 actionability 21 27 unexpectedness rules interesting unknown user contradict users existing knowledge expectations actionability rules interesting user something hisher advantage although unexpectedness actionability important actionability key concept applications actionable rules allow user hisher job better taking specific actions response discovered knowledge 21 27 actionability however elusive concept feasible know space rules actions attached 27 fortunately two measures mutually exclusive interesting rules classified three categories 1 rules unexpected actionable 2 rules unexpected actionable 3 rules actionable expected research focus unexpectedness actionability partially handled unexpectedness actionable rules either expected unexpected thus proposed technique aims find expected unexpected association rules expected rules also called conforming rules conform users existing knowledge expectations 12 generalized association rules discussing proposed technique let us first introduce concept association rules particular generalized association rules 28 generalized association rule model general original association rule model given 2 generalized association rule mining defined follows let set items let g directed acyclic graph items edge g represents isa relationship g set taxonomies taxonomy example shown figure 1 let set transactions transaction set items generalized association rule implication form x x x rule x holds transaction set confidence c c transactions support x also support rule support transactions contains x example association rule could says 10 people buy grape apple together 60 people buy grape also buy apple rule involves items bottom level taxonomy also rules involve items one level example fooditem fruit dairyproduct meat grape pear apple milk cheese butter beef pork chicken figure 1 example taxonomy fruit milk meat 13 summary proposed technique basic idea technique follows system first asks user specify hisher existing knowledge eg beliefs concepts domain analyzes discovered rules identify potentially interesting ones eg unexpected rules proposed technique interactive iterative postprocessing technique see section 3 consists three components 1 specification language allows user specify hisher various types existing knowledge 2 interestngness analysis system analyzes discovered association rules using users specifications analysis identifiy conforming rules unexpected consequent rules unexpected condition rules bothside unexpected rules 3 visualization system enables user visually detect interesting rules easily proposed technique implemented successfully applied number applications system called ias downloaded httpwwwcompnusedusgdm2 paper organized follows next section discuss related work section 3 presents proposed technique section 4 describes visualization system using example section 5 evaluates proposed technique section 6 concludes paper related work existing research rule interestingness focuses either objective interestingness subjective interestingness objective interestingness analyzes rules structure predictive performance statistical significance etc eg 2 3 14 16 18 22 25 31 32 objective interestingness discussed focus paper paper studies subjective interestingness assume objective interestingness analysis 14 3 32 performed remove redundant andor insignificant rules existing approaches finding subjectively interesting association rules ask user explicitly specify types rules interesting uninteresting system generates retrieves matching rules 10 proposes templatebased approach approach user specifies interesting uninteresting association rules using templates template describes set rules terms items occurred conditional consequent parts system retrieves matching rules set discovered rules 29 proposes association rule mining algorithm take item constraints specified user rule mining process rules satisfy constraints generated 20 extends approach allow much sophisticated constraints specified user also uses constraints optimize association rule mining process idea using constraints rule mining process important avoids generating irrelevant rules along similar line also number works based data mining queries example msql 8 dmql 7 metaqueries 26 data mining query basically defines set rules certain type constraints rule found execute query means find rules satisfy query methods view process finding subjectively interesting rules querybased process although queries may considered rule generation rules discovered querybased methods following problems 1 hard find truly unexpected rules find anticipated rules queries derived users existing knowledge space yet many rules satisfy users queries may also interest user never thought unexpected novel forgotten 2 user often know unable specify completely interest himher heshe needs stimulated reminded querybased approaches actively perform task return rules satisfy queries proposed technique identifies conforming rules querybased methods also provides three types unexpected rules thus user exposed possible interesting aspects discovered rules rather focusing hisher current interests heshe may sure unexpected rules truly unexpected serve remind user heshe forgotten iass visualization system also helps user explore interesting rules easily 11 12 reported two techniques analyzing subjective interestingness classification rules however techniques cannot applied analyzing association rules association rules require different specification language different ways analyzing ranking rules 23 24 proposes method discovering unexpected patterns takes consideration set expectations beliefs problem domain method discovers unexpected patterns using expectations seed search patterns data contradict beliefs however method general efficient flexible postanalysis method unless user able specify hisher beliefs expectations domain completely beforehand difficult impossible 4 5 typically user interaction system needed order himher provide complete set expectations find interesting rules postanalysis method facilitates userinteraction efficiency approach given 23 24 also handle users rough vague feelings precise knowledge see section 31 users vague feelings important identifying interesting rules applications found user likely forms knowledge precise knowledge definitions vague feelings precise knowledge given section 31 system wizwhy 31 also method produce unexpected rules method however based objective interestingness analysis depend individual users first computes expected probability rule assuming independence conditions compares expected probability rules actual probability compute unexpectedness 27 proposes use belief systems describe unexpectedness number formal approaches belief systems presented eg bayesian probability dempstershafer theory approaches require user provide complex belief information conditional probabilities difficult obtain practice also existing techniques work contexts specific domains example 21 studies issue finding interesting deviations health care application data mining system kefir analyzes health care information uncover key findings domain expert system constructed evaluate interestingness case actionability key findings approach however application specific also deal association rules method general make domainspecific assumptions 3 ias interestingness analysis system present ias basically ias interactive iterative technique iteration first asks user specify hisher existing knowledge domain uses knowledge analyze discovered rules according interestingness criteria conformity various types unexpectedness analysis identify potentially interesting rules ias system works follows repeat user decides stop 1 user specifies existing knowledge modifies knowledge specified previously 2 system analyzes discovered rules according conformity unexpectedness 3 user inspects analysis results visualization system saves interesting rules removes unwanted rules 31 specification language ias simple specification language enable user express hisher existing knowledge language focuses representing users existing knowledge associative relations items database basic syntax language takes format association rules intuitive simple important practical applications language allows three types specifications represents knowledge different degree preciseness general impressions reasonably precise concepts precise knowledge first two types knowledge represent users vague feelings last type represents hisher precise knowledge division important human knowledge granularities common aspects knowledge domain quite vague aspects precise example may vague feeling impression meat items fruit items associated idea items involved associated however may know precisely past experiences previous data mining session buying bread implies buying milk support around 10 confidence around 70 crucial allow different types knowledge specified determines make use knowledge also whether make use possible knowledge user example system handle precise knowledge user precise knowledge vague impressions cannot use proposed specification language also make use idea class hierarchy taxonomy one used generalized association rules 28 represent hierarchy figure 1 follows grape pear apple fruit fooditem milk cheese butter dairyproduct fooditem beef pork chicken meat fooditem fruit dairyproduct meat fooditems classes class names grape pear apple milk cheese beef pork chicken fruit dairyproduct meat fooditems items note generalized association rules class names also treated items case append front class name note also proposed language class hierarchy need constructed beforehand created fly needed discuss three types knowledge user may input next subsection shows types knowledge used finding conforming unexpected rules general impression gi represents users vague feeling associations among classes items heshe sure associated expressed 1 one following item class expression c c c class c c correspond one zero instances class c respectively 2 discovered rule 1 n b 1 b k conforms gi 1 n b 1 b k considered instance 1 otherwise unexpected respect gi 3 impression actually represents disjunctive propositional formula disjunct implication example gia b c expanded following note b c treated constructed class without name discovered association rule conforms impression rule one disjuncts see formula much complex gi 4 support confidence optional user specify minimum support minimum confidence rules heshe wants see example user believes exist associations among milk cheese fruit items beef assume use class hierarchy figure 1 heshe specifies gimilk cheese fruit beef milk cheese represents class constructed fly unlike fruit following examples association rules conform specification apple beef grape pear beef milk following two rules unexpected respect specification 2 milk cheese pear clothes 1 unexpected fruit satisfied 2 unexpected beef present rule clothes elements gi specification reasonably precise concept rpc represents users concept associations among classes items heshe also knows direction associations expressed 1 v j gi specification 2 discovered rule 1 n b 1 b k conforms rpc rule considered instance rpc otherwise unexpected respect rpc 3 similar gi rpc also represents complex disjunctive propositional formula 4 support confidence optional example 2 suppose user believes following rpcmeat meat dairyproduct grape apple note dairyproduct refers item class following examples association rules conform specification beef pork dairyproduct grape beef chicken dairyproduct grape apple following association rules unexpected respect specification 1 pork dairyproduct grape 2 beef pork grape 3 beef pork milk 1 unexpected one meat item two meat items needed two meats specification 2 unexpected dairyproduct conditional part rule 3 unexpected dairyproduct conditional part rule milk consequent rpc specification knowledge pk user believes precise association expressed 1 v j item 2 discovered rule 1 n b 1 b k sup confid equal pk rule part 1 whether conforms pk unexpected depends support confidence specifications 3 support confidence need specified optional example 3 suppose user believes following pkmeat milk apple 10 30 discovered rule conforms pk quite well supports confidences rule pk quite close meat milk apple 8 33 however discovered rule following meat milk apple 1 10 less conforming unexpected support confidence quite different pk 32 analyzing discovered rules using users existing knowledge existing knowledge user specified system uses analyze discovered rules gis rpcs perform syntaxbased analysis ie comparing syntactic structure discovered rules gis rpcs make sense semanticsbased analysis user precise associations mind using pks perform semanticsbased analysis ie perform support confidence comparisons users specifications discovered rules equal specifications process quite straightforward discussed see 15 details let u set users specifications representing hisher knowledge space set discovered association rules proposed technique matches

visualization system ias discovered rules analyzed ias displays different types potentially interesting rules user key show essential aspects rules take advantage human visual capabilities enable user identify truly interesting rules easily quickly let us discuss essential aspects 1 types potentially interesting rules different types interesting rules separated give user different kinds interesting
