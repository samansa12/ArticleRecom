issue ii make additional assumption bounded level set assumption exists constant l fw j nonempty bounded note assumption a3 implies program solvable shall keep using constant l throughout rest paper given ffl 0 l 0 lebesgue measure following notations 1 2 3 4 consequently feasible region original problem f 4 becomes s0 assumption a3 becomes nonempty bounded prove conditions exist theta 0 l 0 lies

first order necessary z ate theorem 33 assumption a3 exists l 0 compact proof easy see sl b closed l 0 hence prove exists l 0 claim true must exist sequence fl g lim i1 l sl unbounded hence select unbounded sequence fw l l obvious f w l bounded sequence thus find subsequence fk g fl g f wk converges point say nonempty find least one w sufficiently small equivalently 2 therefore fi 0 contradicts assumption a3 using constant l 0 obtained theorem 33 derive following results lemma 34 given ffl 0 l proof since closed subset lb compact exists sequence f compact exists subsequence converges point
