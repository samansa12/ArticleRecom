semantically related personal information space paper compare two metrics one userdriven one contentdriven used determine web page similarity relations sensemaking tasks current web browsers try alleviate sensemaking problems raised use bookmarks favorites mechanisms wherein users store urls interesting web pages order build personalized information space despite user interface mechanisms 1998 survey 10000 web users revealed one common problems users web organizing information gather 7 chi 99 1520 may 1999 papers related research abrams et al 1 studied bookmark archives personal web

implicit query technique shows user items related current interest implicit query algorithms determine similarities among web pages present results visual format observed useful usable approach allows

data mountain 3d document management system see figure 2 design implementation data mountain described 13 short overview environment provided currently data mountain used alternative web browsers favorites bookmark mechanism understood forms documents work equally well new environment data mountain uses planar surface tilted degrees see figure 2 documents dragged document dragged remains visible user always aware surrounding pages user place figure 2 data mountain 100 web pages web pages documents anywhere surface practice user creates meaning organizing space lays documents study user allowed freely choose organizational method adjust point throughout study user clicks page stored data mountain page animated forward preferred viewing position shown figure 1 preferred viewing position another click put page back data mountain last known location practice click url would allow user follow link also stored page moved time dragging mouse since page visible move user knows page drag terminated movement continuous constrained surface data mountain user moves page around data mountain likely bump pages objects allowed intersect users dragging action constrained instead handle collisions displacing previously placed pages thus continually maintaining minimum distance pages transitively propagating displacement neighbors necessary user dragging page continually sees state result drag terminated ie animated settling time displacement technique also ensures pages never get fully obscured number cues designed facilitate spatial cognition obvious 3d depth cues perspective view accompanying size differences occlusion particularly pages moved simple circular landmarks surface data mountain also offer spatial cues may may utilized page placement retrieval less obvious also quite important shadows cast web pages papers chi 99 1520 may 1999 subtle pervasive spatial audio cues accompany animations user actions reinforce visual cues sound effects highly dynamic example dragging page user hears humming sound changes pitch based speed page moved careful use timbre stereo attenuation humming sound users thus provided additional spatial location indicator
