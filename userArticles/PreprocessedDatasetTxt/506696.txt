question commonly accepted patterns reasoning involving theories generate multiple extensions particular argue phenomenon floating conclusions indicates problem view skeptical consequences theories identified statements supported various extensions multiple extensions canonical example knowledge base multiple extensions nixon diamond depicted figure 1 statements qn rn pn represent propositions

arbitrary different reasoners could easily select different extensions reasoner might select different extensions different times extension would represent real conclusion set original theory second three optionsendorse conclusion whenever contained extension could indeed codified consequence relation would peculiar one according policy conclusion set associated default theory need closed standard logical consequence might easily inconsistent even cases underlying default theory seems consistent conclusion set theory representing nixon diamond example would contain pn pn since formulas belongs extension default theory would contain pn pn since formula contained extension one way avoiding peculiar features second option think conclusions generated default theory shielded kind modal operator statement let ba mean good reason believe suppose theory provides us good reason believe statement whenever statement included extension theory internally coherent point view could define

determining whether ba belongs conclusion set defined unfortunately however variant second option also manages sidestep original question wanted know conclusions actually draw information provided

good reason believe may useful information still distance telling us whether conclude nixon pacifist 2 three options defining notion consequence presence multiple exten sions third skeptical proposalendorse conclusion whenever contained every extensionseems hold real promise option leads single conclusion set closed logical consequence consistent long initial information provides answer least initially attractive original question concerning proper conclusions case nixon diamond example since neither pn pn belongs every extension third option tell us conclude nixon pacifist conclude nixon pacifist either since good reason conflicting conclusion remain skeptical floating conclusions logic defines direct unmediated relation particular default theory statement sets form extensions another class formalismsknown argument systemstakes roundabout approach analyzing nonmonotonic reasoning study interactions among competing defeasible arguments 3 although arguments studied argument systems often com plex restrict attention entirely linear arguments analogous reasoning paths studied theories defeasible inheritance 4 linear arguments formed starting true statement simply stringing

development argument system specification coherent sets arguments ideal reasoner might willing accept basis given body initial information refer coherent sets arguments argument extensions distinguish statement extensions defined theories default logic actual definition argument extensions often complicated ways need concern us without going detail however simply note theories like default logic

reasoner whose standards calibrated accept statements receive uniform support reject floating conclusions second comment notice floating conclusions pose problem problem argument systems also traditional nonmonotonic formalisms default model preference logics indeed problem even serious traditional formalisms argument systems extensions generated argument extensions least possible avoid floating conclusions adopting first two skeptical alternativesendorsing arguments belonging extension endorsing conclusions endorsed arguments since arguments represented explicitly systems used filter floating conclusions traditional nonmonotonic logics arguments suppressed materials carrying kind filtering policy even available illustrate natural representation information yacht example

skeptical reasoning appears intersect extensions since statement f belongs extensions skeptical reasoning default logic tells immediately without ambiguity inherit half million dollars course default
