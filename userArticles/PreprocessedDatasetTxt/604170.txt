consensus operator combining beliefs consensus operator provides method combining possibly conflicting beliefs within dempstershafer belief theory represents alternative traditional dempsters rule paper describes consensus operator applied dogmatic conflicting opinions ie degree conflict high overcomes shortcomings dempsters rule operators proposed combining possibly conflicting beliefs b introduction ever since publication shafers book mathematical theory evidence 1 continuous controversy around socalled dempsters rule purpose dempsters rule combine two conflicting beliefs single belief reflects two conflicting beliefs fair equal way dempsters rule criticised mainly highly conflicting beliefs tend produce counterintuitive results formulated form examples zadeh 2 cohen 3 among others problem dempsters rule due normalisation redistributes conflicting belief masses nonconflicting beliefs thereby tends eliminate conflicting characteristics resulting belief mass distribution alternative called nonnormalised dempsters rule proposed smets 4 avoids particular problem allocating conflicting belief masses empty set smets explains arguing 1 work reported paper funded part

provides comparison consensus operator two variants dempsters rule discussion results provided section 6 representing uncertain beliefs first step applying dempstershafer belief model 1 define set possible states given system called frame discernment denoted powerset denoted 2 contains possible unions sets including elementary sets frame discernment called atomic sets contain subsets assumed

consensus operator produces results consistent statistical analysis see 6 absence criteria intuitive formal judgement constitutes strong argument favour consensus operator 6 discussion conclusion addition three belief combination rules analysed numerous others presented literature eg rule proposed yager 12 transfers conflicting belief mass whenever x rule proposed dubois prade 13 transfers conflicting belief mass xy whenever rules commutative unfortunately associative seems counterintuitive assuming beliefs different sources treated way result depend order combined analysing rules dempster smets yager dubois prade well simple statistical average murphy 14 rejects rules yager dubois prade lack sociativity concludes dempsters rule performs best convergence properties accompanied statistical average warn possible errors degree conflict high consensus operator seems combine desirable convergence properties dempsters rule degree conflict low natural average beliefs degree conflict high mentioned lefevre et al 15 dempsters rule nonnormalised version require belief sources reliable whereas yagers dubois prades rules require least one belief sources reliable result meaningful consensus operator make assumption reliability belief sources course escape garbage garbage principle argument could used consensus operator give indication possible belief conflict indeed looking result tell whether original beliefs harmony conflict would nice possible way incorporate degree conflict add extra conflict parameter could example belief mass assigned smets rule opinion
