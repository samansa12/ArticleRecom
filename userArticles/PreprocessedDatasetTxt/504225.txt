seamlessly integrated interface less desirable variant method used symbolics document examiner walker 1987 link markers hidden well highlighted mouse passed forces hunt peck search active regions microcosm dls user query system invisible links marking word text issue search matching links carr et al 1995 though anchors marked model well applicable generic links given words selected anchors ignoring previous experiences mosaic returned colored blue underlined text indicate link markers optimal solution emphasizes link marker text permanently underlined markers stick surrounding text decrease readability underlining interferes descenders letters drop line like p q j blue color also imperfect choice since especially elderly people problems perceive human eye less sensitive color blue colors lythgoe 1979 reasons mosaics link marker appearance obviously technical nature quite simple implement time computers 16 colors black white display blue darkest available colors closest black text monochrome displays text underlined ncsa 1996 pervasiveness web led us accept underlined colored text de facto marker standard mainstream hypertext systems today found help systems various platforms even operating system components like microsoft windows explorer though use standard desirable consistency point view user interfaces otherwise improved still wedged historical hack recent technologies like cascading style sheets bos et al 1998 allow define appearance text links various ways also look links configured somehow current browsers however standard setting still blue underlined links demand still possible even worse visualization link maps graphics standard method found implemented web browsers shows important design user interfaces well considering earlier experiences even interface obvious design mistakes become standard enter xml linking concept links made possible create nonsequential texts rich hypertext systems offer sophisticated functionality ie support comprehensive structuring editing navigation features yankelovich et al 1988 bieber et al 1997 however date web supports embedded oneway links limitation made authoring web pages development web servers browsers simple enabling web grow extremely fast hand approaches try integrate extended functionality web utilize workarounds overcome weaknesses simple approach also hard compete wellknown standard browsers often better suited display existing stylishly designed web pages advent xml linking web able offer many features hypertext experts missing today vitali bieber 1999 standard browsers already migrate xml xslt clark 1999 hopefully linking become widely available soon linking potential xml linking1 based two key standards necessary create describe links link anchors xlink defines links relation resources portions thereof syntactically link consists arbitrary number resources local remote arcs resource addressable unit information service arcs create directed

wellknown hypertext models dexter halasz 1990 hytime derose durand 1994 features almost matching sometimes exceeding xlink system ever fully implemented grnbk trigg 1999 p 42 nonetheless many systems existed far ahead time offered functionality available web today enables us find ideas detect problems looking systems implemented visualized hyperlinks map user interfaces programs linking features made available introduction xlink thus discuss needed user profit extended functionality separation structure content several former open hypermedia systems like microcosm dls carr et al 1995 devise hypermedia system permitted store links separately documents dedicated linkbases likewise xlink allow separation structure content web external storage links permits multiple linkbases used single web pages links may originate original author also authors without write access original document like single user members group2 use several different linkbases result unintentionally great number links3 therefore user must enabled select employed linkbases example method found third voice browser plugin adds annotations web pages4 fig 5 part functionality service adds links external linkbase keywords

offers choice targets microcosmsdls already permitted use several linkbases offered configuration screen select utilized link database given set carr et al 1996 unfortunately menu directly integrated browser interface addition new linkbases quite complicated xlink browser also need potential find new linkbases5 add personal list far standard means established bidirectional links technical point view bidirectional links help links consistent avoid broken links usability viewpoint also permit follow links backwards opposed unidirectional goto links web user could use feature find eg recent information referring old valuable document benefit bidirectional linking user interface support backward traversal links hypertext systems bidirectional links like sepia macweb hyperg offered local map showing nodes connecting links visualizes topology permits user select source objects directly map additional links used annotate supplement existing information information personal importance 3 links may also overlap see following sections third voice available httpwwwthirdvoicecom 5 furthermore primary linkbase frequently change browsing web usually provided server hosting current document web retrieval links refer current document poses serious problem prototype web browser tool described chakrabarti et al 1999 gathered information search engines alternatively proposed extend http

maps use lot screen space dozens nodes links displayed thus number objects limited eg filtering appropriate ones typed links link type describes relationship source destination link often derived semantic categories like explanation example trigg 1983 introduced help users get better idea link target streitz et al list semantic link information first principle useful hypermedia system design streitz et al 1992 however typed links helpful user distinguish different types tim bernerslees www proposal bernerslee 1989 included typed links html allows web authors set link type attributes rel

explanatory popup links green dotted underline uses icons indicate specific actions execution program however potentials text style quite limited inline icons distracting create problems layout figure different mouse pointers utilized guide system guide system utilized different mouse pointers make link characteristics apparent brown 1987 pointer changed according link type hovered link fig 6 since mouse pointers independent screen text layout may interesting option web clients standard software like word processors graphics programs also operating systems commonly employ differently shaped mouse pointers possible indicate many different actions nonobtrusive yet immediately visible manner multiple endpoints links multiple endpoints connect two set related nodes thus different alternative destinations provided user initiates traversal link multiple endpoints requested choose available options solution preferred former hypertext systems microcosm dls presented list generated link

select decent destination applying filter already father hypertext vannevar bush suggested filters links user follows guided tour links displayed documents hidden bieber 97 bush 45 could filter links link attributes hyperg user rights would even desirable filter semantic criteria like users task profile complex link anchors many web usability guidelines confine setting length link markers eg nielsen recommends link markers 5 words long nielsen 2000 restriction concession limited link visualization potentials current web browsers extended link spans result hardly readable underlined text regions hypertext systems displayed links demand avoided readability problems xml linking standard allows arbitrary complex link anchors explained even possible create discontinuous anchors ie anchors consist several distinct regions user may appear like multiple anchors share destination irritating web system evaluations already links displayed one line found confusing beginning end anchor indicated browsers used spool et al 1999 consequently extent link marker visuali zed possible recent web browsers link marker highlighted mouse hovers link however browser configuration changed appropriate css must defined overlapping link markers link markers may overlap either author creates two anchors two intersecting text sections related different destinations6 authors create anchors overlapping link spans original author hardly current web user familiar idea overlapping link markers cannot found web popular hypertext system currently possible create constructs html since way distinguish different opening closing anchor tags technological problem easily solved even embedded links hypergs markup language htf demonstrated used link identifiers associate opening closing link

more7 vision improved hypertext user interfaces web undoubtedly successful distributed hypertext system ever despite simplicity already serious usability problems must prevented becomes worse extended linking features introduced would like revive discussion presenting ideas user interface strategy extended links accomplish consolidated experiences earlier hypertext research established innovative

information server version 55 uses html markup language figure 8 mockup outgoing xlinks overlap marked transparency note marked scrollbar analogy hypertext reader traveler introduced landows authoritative rhetoric hypertext paper divides interaction links two key parts departure arrival landow 1987 landows ideas based experiences inter media background later hypertext research enriched linking capabilities xlink discrimination possible action departure split two subactions first problem locating point departure identifying link markers second problem getting sufficient information destination journey understanding link relationship considering arrival procedure reader must get reception destination understand extent context referenced material direction came ie origin journey last page visited therefore known finally xlink allow links connect two endpoints also possible build xlinks represent whole paths structures thus xlink last embodies standard web storage format structural information eg guided paths hierarchical site maps discuss uses hidden links hid den sense originating rendered page content separate section point departure current methods web authors emphasizing text anchors using color style using specially tailored graphics mark graphical link anchors already common probably continue exist xlink introduced however illustrated methods potential identify extended externally defined xlinks furthermore prevalent standard visualization method found identify graphical image map links consequently new schemata needed display supplementary links eg external linkbase provided xlink service usability point view consistent uniform technique desirable distract reading interfere text graphical layout tech niques enables user identify even complex anchors clearly think appropriate way accomplish might use transparent areas overlaid hypertext document overlays advantage feasible text graphics indicating active areas directly masking applied also places document author plan link possible distraction reduced using soft light colors bright background shady colors dark background user tests sophisticated transparent user interfaces showed promising results harrison 1995 cox 1998 important factor considered link den sity ratio marker area unlinked area high distinctive anchor appearance may overwhelm normal text since arbitrary number alien links relate xml web page selection mechanism prevent phenomenon would call link overload similar information overload could overshadow interaction potentials approaching xlink web therefore user interface must provide means select links put view calls linksondemand display techni ques selection mechanism may provided additional tool bar window link database browser could displayed left

external links permits construction hyperbase systems offer compiled collections links eg result query grnbaek trigg 1999 p 167 services could provided like today search engines web catalogues linkbases making appear disappear colors may used associate listed linkbases anchors screen fig 8 link starts anchor longer words overall readability text rapidly decreases least long persistent highlighting used introduction xlink source anchors become arbitrarily long question becomes increasingly important suggest simple method reduce impact read ability narrow bar right side anchored paragraph use different techniques short long anchors suggested looking use conventional paper markup paper consists highlighting words coloring transparent marker longer passages need distinguished marking whole paragraphs using vertical lines page border sometimes title given help recognize underlying concepts passage markup style advantage apparent distracting long underlined text uses little screen space goes along well layouts since simple technique show exact location link marker start end supplemented rollover effect scrollbar optionally smallscale overview window could used show location link anchors outside currently visible page section using scrollbar locate particular areas long web pages already suggested laakso laakso overlapping links several linkbases could visualized transparent overlays defined neutral color like bright gray user clicks area transparent popup appears showing list available link titles color associated database moving mouse transparent items highlight related link markers document destinations first sight less uniform looking links web typed apart marked text preview user always get web browser destination uri spool et al 1999 even scant

information link targets differ type mailto links downloads availability broken links size connection speed affecting download time information semantic nature like title author language target document structural hints like indicating outofsite links could used automatically enhance link preview paper project hyperscout already suggested techniques display information popups weinreich 2000 figure 9 popup menu renders xlinkspecific automatically gathered information xlinks title information also straightforwardly displayed popup window machinereadable information provided compute type information used induce alternative traversal behavior get advance information file types target documents could also used filter links according specified user profile leads alternative browser behavior must hidden user addition popups suggest use different mouse pointers immediately indicate link actions comparable method guide system xlink offers several destinations problem selection occurs popup menus list available links suggested xlink definition publications derose 2000 bosak bray1999 however disadvantage require additional user action user first choose link click choose target anchor click would suggest use role attributes allow filtering thus displaying part link targets available certain cases might even desirable default destrination automatically selected left mouse button clicked indicated mouse pointer popup appears right mouse click presenting choice complementary link targets arrival rhetoric arrival sense landow requires reader gets feeling welcome destination document one must employ devices enforce hypertext capacity establish intellectual relations landow 1987 establishing intellectual relation requires user determine target link context method todays web browsers present target simple whole document shown fragment identifier specified browser tries scroll position fragment anchor fact known usability problem web span link target visualized user cannot identify extent destination fragment locator near end page browser often cannot scroll sufficiently display link target top window tim bernerslees first graphical web browser nextstep system later versions mosaic already highlight target anchor caillau ashman 1999 feature lost current mainstream browsers since already suggested transparent highlighting areas identify starting anchors different method would advisable prevent misconceptions figure 10 mockup showing incoming link target context information coreferences suggest technique long known work paper lateral marker lines narrow bar far left side window used indicate target span chance confusing incoming outgoing links thus incoming links left vs outgoing links right kept minimum devise hypertext system utilized similar technique indicate target anchors grnbk trigg 1999 p 314 precise visualization target becomes necessary eg tables ondemand method may used moving mouse marker bar shade rest document except target area method already used harmonys postscript viewer andrews 1996 target section larger visible window clicking bar pin shading user may scroll page additionally scrollbar may used show extent target span compared whole page especially useful fit window although precise notion target anchor specified xml linking weakness xlink emerges standard lacks definition link context nanard nanard argue distinction link anchor trigger link context minimum reading context ends link link anchor usually quite short focused link context embedding anchor enabling reader understand relationship link better nanard nanard 1993 hardman et al 1994 meaning sequence words change severely torn context ie surrounding sentence paragraph chapter xlink misses explicit definition context spans serious dis advantage could easily fixed additional attribute resource tags anchor selected context made visible also sometimes useful supplement links pointing target anchor called coreferences links could collected earlier sessions retrieved search engines compiled linkbase systems stem material visited course current search followed reverse direction provide material related current target anchor suggest make appropriate coreferences last navigated link available right clicking lateral marker bar right click opens popup link anchors double click used open larger list left side browser references pointing document finally think would feasible apply filtering mechanisms utilizing arc roles eg display links use current anchor example use hidden links far tried optimize visualization hyperlinks markers documents however xlink also used describe relations without markers eg nonassociative structural xlinks links either supplied author site external source eg guided tour trail hammond allinson 1987 bush 1945 automatically generated link overview maps local map fisheye view 3d landscapes often seem confusing helpful used large hyperspaces utting yankelovich 1989 immense size distribution web structural information provided overview truly help find semantically related content special link type introduced html 20 link rel distinguish structural associative links bernerslee 1995 though made possible separate structurerelated contentrelated navigation poorly supported current web browsers less widely spread browsers like lynx icab fig 10 support use structural links thus far handful web sites offer structural links yet information could often easily provided especially generated web content sites created authoring tool figure 11 icabs structural link navigation toolbar support structural information xlinks special link roles arc roles would defined ever would use role attributes semantic rather syntactical information would possible provide complete structures eg guided tours site maps single link something possible link element link markers consistent interface needed structural navigation suggest xlinkaware browsers provide icablike toolbar basic structural navigation furthermore hierarchical view like hyper gs collection tree browser provided demand additional navigation tool displayed browser window eg place sidebar interface also provide standard interface guided tours metastructures thereby eliminating need workarounds also imagine hybrid xlinks bear structure link markers web page9 implicit structure could extracted displayed standard 9 structural links include links homepage pointing site site logos pointing homepage arrows next last pages etc ized user interface original embedded links hidden user thus either use consistent standard interface without search navigation follow rendered structural links without leave page context conclusion usability become key factor success soft ware despite intensive research hypertext systems standard hyperlink user interface agreed thus bound defacto standard web design many inherent weaknesses agree extended linking features experiences software engineering shown better initial design system include user interface well functionality nielsen 1993 representation data secondary importance demonstrates need reconsidering currently developed standards xlink
