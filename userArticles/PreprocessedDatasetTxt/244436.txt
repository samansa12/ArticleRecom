bruhat order b hold remaining possibility w rank 3 every edge gamma infinite weight follows must exist generators u 2 62 j either case 1 consider elements uts sts suts usts easy see every reduced word elements ends belong w j secondly hard show using subword property eg h x510 otherwise two elements length four upper bounds two elements length three respect bruhat order b hold fact sts suts unrelated respect weak order shows hold also claim elements sts uts upper bounds relative l definition upper bounds sts reduced expressions form wsts since braid relations w involve pairs commuting generators follows every reduced word wsts must least two occurrences following occurrence u particular reduced word end u wsts cannot upper bound uts hence w j l lattice c fails case 2 consider elements tuts suts tsuts stuts easy see every reduced word elements ends belong w j using subword property one sees elements length five upper bounds elements length four respect bruhat order b fail also tuts tsuts unrelated respect l fails finally argue tuts suts upper bounds relative l indeed wsuts reduced every reduced word x must exactly one occurring last two occurrences particular reduced
