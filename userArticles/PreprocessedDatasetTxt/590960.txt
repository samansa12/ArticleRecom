number approaches briefly discussed detailed treatment see 11 profile user used determine interesting information item user used select prioritise information items personalised manner structure properties profiling approaches may vary application area used example multiattribute decision systems see 32337 user profile preference item defined terms values various attributes item preferences user towards attributes ie importance attributes hand area recommendation systems profile may well defined terms statistical correlation users rated items preferences user towards set items defined terms content items content information preference items society users collaborative social information contentbased approach user defined preference item item similar attribute values items preferred user also ratings relative relevance attributes user often included collaborativebased approach user defined preference item user similar preferences items users preference item content information well collaborative information used construct user profiles construction profile time consuming matter example contentbased approach user may express preferences towards various combinations attributes attribute values extensive forms systems eg see 12 derive preferences user suggesting item user ask correct suggestion user corrects systems suggestion indicating suggested item match needs based corrections profiles users constructed updated collaborativebased applications recommendation systems user may asked rate several sometimes hundreds items item recommended number systems employ methods induce user profile observing behaviour user time eg see 16262931 methods usually intended fully model user profiles model frequent predictable user preferences applications require huge efforts users may become ineffective eg see 2728 model user profiles application balance found amount interaction user effectiveness constructed user profile modelling user profiles basis content collaborative information considered learning problem aim learn socalled preference function certain user preference function user maps items certain domain values express importance items user various types preference functions may exist type preference function characterises structure profile eg see 2337 another profile learning approach based inductive logic programming found 5 6 11 several collaborativebased recommendation systems introduced preferences users modelled automatically examples online recommendation systems employ collaborative approach moviefinder 39 firefly 13 preferences user modelled automatically observing behaviour user applying statistical methods observed behaviour eg see 4161733 contrast collaborativebased approach contentbased approach applied items described terms properties attribute values contentbased profiling approaches used online recommendation systems bargainfinder 1 jango 18 unlike collaborativebased preference models contentbased preference models also used applications integrative negotiation utility function defined terms user preferences towards various attribute values eg see 315232937 collaborativebased contentbased approaches exclude fact combined integrated approach model user profiles see 2 effectivity collaborativebased contentbased approaches profiling may depend application example collaborativebased profiling approaches may effective applications unrealistic collect large amount information preferences individual user number users large using collaborativebased profiling models also effective applications content items neither available analysed automatically machine eg items like picture video sound however collaborativebased profiling approaches less effective applications like integrative negotiation eg see 314 retail electronic commerce negotiation considered decision making process items described multiple interdependent attributes 5 reuse generic architecture insurance
