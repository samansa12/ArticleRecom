broadcasts entire network member advertising packet called join request periodic transmission refreshes membership information updates routes follows node receives nonduplicate join request stores upstream node address route table ie backward learning rebroadcasts packet join request packet reaches multicast receiver receiver creates updates source entry member table valid entries exist member

join tables different ret values ie lies paths source multiple ceivers selects minimum ret among sends join table chosen ret value attached source receives join tables selects minimum ret among received join tables source builds new routes flooding join request minimum ret approaches ie route breaks note multicast receivers need periodically transmit join tables since sources flood join requests needed receivers send join tables receiving join requests addition estimated ret value need consider factors choosing route refresh interval node mobility rate high topology changes frequently routes expire quickly often source may propagate join requests excessively excessive flooding cause collisions congestion clogs network control packets thus min refresh interval enforced
