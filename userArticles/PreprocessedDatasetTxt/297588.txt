finally give brief outlook future work b introduction computer supported cooperative work cscw interdisciplinary field research dealing cooperative work supported computer systems overview see eg 6 computer science naturally major contributor however psychology sociology disciplines involved well developers cscw systems groupware design single users interacting system also groups interacting via system collaborative perspective raises amplifies instance issues like privacy access control 9 23 conflicts 27 awareness 4 7 tailorability 21 22 discuss briefly following order give reader overview challenges groupware design early 1986 context first cscw conference greif sarin 9 stated access control mechanisms concepts used operating systems time flexible enough express access policies group interaction suggested development sophisticated controls taking account additional factors like user roles access rights concerning abstract operations read write eg sharing operations specific objectuserrelationships eg current past users object shen dewan 23 discuss problem access rights collaborative work context multiuser editor suite stress dynamic nature collaborative work thus state support multiple dynamic user roles need easy specification access rights important requirements access control groupware furthermore introduce specific collaboration rights operations whose results affect users fact groupware functionality affect multiple users gives rise strong potential conflict concerning configuration use systems 27 groupware systems distinctively change division labor organization obliterate jobs open new opportunities communication employees development might interest management furthermore supporting communication coordination computers opens new ways controlling monitoring work often small things like publicly visible creation date document cause vehement negative reactions groupware users groupware systems allow control work processes one hand hand important context information obliterated cooperating eg via shared document work space even small clues like seeing overflowing physical inbox colleague hearing voice somebody hallway might formerly helpful deciding questions like send document ask completion piece work supporting cooperative work computers raises issue awareness see eg 4 groupware users sometimes need aware going systems users currently done past designing mechanisms provide awareness groupware nontrivial one walk tightrope concerning conflicting goals privacy versus need awareness information overflow versus lack awareness fuchs et al 7 present one solution problem model awareness mechanism characterized high degree tailorability ie adapted different dynamically changing needs preferences individuals groups organizations tailorability adaptability also issue outside cscw complexity dynamics diversity cooperative work increase importance field beyond configuration awareness mechanisms see eg 21 22 furthermore fact groupware functionality potential affect multiple users raises question allowed tailor functionality one explore try tailored functionality without disturbing users access control potential conflicts awareness tailorability examples means issues arise design cscw functionality however extending use computers support single users support groups functionality also development processes rethought 10 gives extensive overview novel challenges groupware designers face among others identifies need almost unanimous acceptance groupware order achieve critical mass users well balanced benefit profile eg subordinates gain much system managers key factors success groupware thus groupware developers know much context use prospective application developers single user applications pay much attention grouprelated aspects like instance trust awareness negotiations social dynamics power structures work processes trust awareness negotiation aspects proved highly relevant design case described later

evaluation cscw systems 3 identifies several different roles scenarios play development process software employ scenarios cscw design process three roles tool first informal requirements analysis communication support userdesigner designerdesigner validation evaluation support figure 1 shows scenario supported steps positioned overall design process note process cyclical believe value cooperation scenarios lies foremost first cycles attempting identify create innovative functionality supports cooperative work later cycles rely formal methods models form cooperation scenarios scenarios take many different forms 18 describes two extreme positions concerning scope scenarios first one sees scenario external description system p 21 second one looks use process situated larger context page according different positions scenarios take form exact protocols formal sequence descriptions one hand rather broad mostly textual descriptions also covering contextual aspects loosely related however relevant system design hand also see 3 purposes need form scenario allows designers capture broad range eventually unanticipated contextual information thus cooperation scenarios based informal textual descriptions work practices including motivation goals behind cooperation textual form also facilitates discussion users designers role communication support among designers first representation later augmented alternatives especially visual techniques workshops work place visits requirements informal textual scenarios design functionality evaluation without users eg rolebased analysis scenarios yielding benefit profile evaluation users presentation discussion new functionality based scenarios redesign redesign validation scenarios use cyclical design politeam project scenario based process steps figure 1 scenario support politeam design process building cooperation scenarios information captured cooperation scenarios gathered politeam project extensive field studies involving semistructured interviews work place visits techniques usually single user oriented attempt identify role person plays organizations different cooperative tasks question individual motivations goals especially important context groupware development product acceptable users radically different roles respect cooperative activity supported system eg managers subordinates see 10 purpose use call continuously refined heuristic user selection schemes see 25 identified cooperative activity attempt identify users involved activity interviews work place visits select users play different roles cooperation however initial selection users often exhaustive learn processes target organizations identify additional users might play different role subtle however relevant way thus continuously refine user selection methodologically important aspect cooperation scenarios degree cooperation respective field application already supported computer systems three scenarios described next section range full computer support completely nonit based activities might subject future groupware support existing work practices usually heavily influenced features problems see scenario one computer system already place essential abstract existing technology order understand nature especially motivation goals behind cooperative activity main point article make case value scenarios support developing understanding additionally discuss value scenarios evaluation phase three example scenarios concerning access control context collaborative activities first politeam version introduced quickly became obvious users severe problems traditional matrix based access control system see eg 20 use order understand nature problems began investigate work practices revolving around access collaboratively used documents three scenarios presented section distilled series interviews two fields application politeam project additional interview session newsletters editorial office workshop users federal ministry involved politeam project workshop also concerned questions relevant confused feedback workshop described later paper scenarios analysis taken 26 used motivate novel aspects access control system main points 26 technical aspects implementation system thus employs formal method scenarios petri nets order describe discuss implementation details alternatives heart novel functionality 26 discuss design process first scenario state representative body keeping user passwords sealed envelopes strongbox scenario based representative body north german state federal capital bonn participant politeam project body equipped groupware system supporting internal cooperation well cooperation state government state capital installation consists 28 workstations important cooperative task supported preparation documents states vote bundesrat german assembly states representatives cooperative activity rather time constrained decisions concerning states vote coordinated distributed validated within short time frame one week order deal unexpected absences due illness travel office implemented seemingly complex rather effective nonitbased work practice around politeam groupware system every user write password piece paper placed sealed envelope envelope locked away office strongbox keys strongbox kept two trusted persons system administrator department head following referred keyholders person urgently needs access document virtual desk absentee person ask one keyholders open strongbox release envelope password envelope opened virtual desk accessed appropriate password one hand work practice effective sense misuse illegitimate access difficult necessity negotiate keyholder release envelope broken seal envelope indicator virtual desktop accessed hand granularity access granted system rather coarse since password released every possible action taken name absent person documents one needed accessed deleted mails sent received additionally eventual change user password causing organizational overhead password changed system also new envelope placed strongbox theoretically person could use several virtual desktops different password achieve finer granularity solution however would severely decrease effectiveness regular use system since users would log system change one task another second scenario federal ministry searching colleagues desktops watchful eyes trustworthy third person different scenario discovered department german federal ministry department also participates politeam groupware application used 12 employees mainly operative section central typing office application supports cooperative generation documents typically involving head section member section several typists course work members section occasionally search documents colleagues virtual desktops instance need specific document know working right task politeam base system provides search tool allows users search access documents explicitly declared private tool however severely constrained installed version groupware system initial requirement analysis users objected tool due privacy considerations current version tool search folderhierarchy ones virtual desktop conventions established deal problem searching work outside ones virtual desktop users held keep documents jointly created shared workspaces member section workspace whose access shares head section typists thus two typists working section link shared workspaces desktop means conduct departmentwide search documents one workers section looks specific document outside desktop asks search provide link politeam concept shared access documents found document advantage work practice two typists aware every departmentwide search considered extremely trustworthy nobody feels privacy invaded disadvantage access documents still anticipated order documents kept shared workspaces furthermore typists actually search copy link respective documents practice results additional work even though sole point aware search intervene doubt appropriateness third scenario newsletter editorial offices smoothing cooperation limited trespassing private domains another example successful workpractice physical world difficult support classical access control systems encountered editorial offices small newsletter specialized providing indepth information eu agricultural matters interested parties seven editors responsible three eu countries thus theory work editors noncollaborative however practice lot information concerns transnational aspects eg studies comparing agricultural performance several eu countries simply newspaper article one country concerns another country consequence editors heavily rely kept date colleagues supporting mechanism collaboration physical circulation system based number open postboxes main hall suite offices post 6boxes also used distributing normal mail editors editor wants share document colleagues simply writes initials respective persons document drops one postboxes sometimes editor sharing information decides afterwards needs document might tell one colleagues document lunch might discover exactly information looking weeks immediately needs see document document question however still resides one postboxes main hall thus order speed process editor searches postboxes colleagues however would dare remove documents look closely private mail faxes postboxes located main hall likely colleague might pass similar last scenario editor respecting social protocol according interviews custom honored even last person leaving office night trying support kind workpractice computer system one quickly reaches limit classical access control system analyzing using scenarios guide design process used three scenarios described basis development new access control model found cooperation scenarios useful point revealed us problems traditional access control systems collaborative work practice seen following briefly describe three observations taken 26 indicate traditional access control mechanisms support current collaborative work practice well observations based information captured three scenarios guided subsequent design process particular integration negotiation notification mechanisms access control system observation 1 trusted third persons play important role three scenarios role trusted third person central feature first two scenarios state representative office employees put envelopes passwords strongbox well knowing others keys keyholders trusted abuse powers similar federal ministry typists considered trustworthy colleagues thus allowed search documents restricted spaces trusted third persons obviously play important role dealing unexpected absences exactly point classical access control system fail systems deal two roles one specifies access rules one tries access document access policies eg form access lists matrices specified advance precisely denying permitting access object certain persons groups problem two scenarios users would like unexpected accesses decided upon advance trusted third person context actual access situation eg typists theory scenarios could supported traditional access control system granting full access trusted person advance solution however consequence trusted person would burdened decision concerning access also actual work ie accessing copying document person requesting access scenario federal ministry unanticipated accesses exceptional solution acceptable trusted persons thus makes sense look efficient implementation requirements within access control system observation 2 awareness used control access awareness plays important role three scenarios state representative office passwords sealed envelopes broken seal indicates password used thus degree awareness accesses ones desktop federal ministry access restricted spaces made aware typists awareness ensures every access carefully considered one held accountable every action situation editorial offices rather similar position postboxes main hall provides degree awareness ensures editors boxes accessed justifiable reason awareness plays important role supporting enforcing social protocols conventions point classical access control systems fail allow options yes yes want know yes want typists know politeam base system includes functionality allows users register interest changes specific documents functionality however much coarse differentiate different kinds accesses additionally specified one document time induces lot overhead trying use functionality real work practice observation 3 access subject negotiation time access looking work practices described scenarios obvious great need negotiation reason possible precisely specify access rights advance anticipated specification replaced negotiate sic actual situation use either trusted third person see first subsection owner document scenarios necessity negotiation direct consequence application trust respective organization scenario taken state representative body one negotiate one keyholders release password keyholder opportunity grant deny access according understanding motives current context federal ministry one negotiate one typists order search certain documents implementation based analysis developed new access control model integrates awareness negotiation services traditional anticipative access control system specifying access rights document shared folder users opportunity allow deny access advance two additional options notification negotiation former allows access notifies single user group access latter allows access specified single user group agrees detailed discussion implementation see 26 scenario supported evaluation far described use cooperation scenarios purpose capturing requirements stem cooperative work practice guide design new cscw functionality however also found scenarios useful evaluation phase mentioned introduction evaluating groupware rather difficult due many factors involved success failure product fullfledged test groups users preferably work place impractical product reached certain maturity especially stability groups users invited lab leave lot important context factors behind subjected several new ones strategy capture much relevant context possible cooperation scenarios especially motivation goals also workload different participating roles try evaluate designs information early possible process specifically use scenarios evaluation three stages design

differences interpretation relevant details despite fact authors attended first workshop protocolled authors conducted relevant interviews together audiotaped good example significant misinterpretation discovered writing discussing scenario two workshop one attendees federal ministry talking searching peoples desktops importance trusted persons knowing search referring virtual desktops colleagues clear everybody knowing office three stories colleagues talking however author writing workshop protocol know assumed talking physical desktops mistake finally discovered author reviewed scenario believe misinterpretations like major problem design processes user participation common misconceptions cemented call project folklore ie things designers believe even passed new project members facts cooperation scenarios rely anecdotal evidence severely distorted depending writes prior knowledge person field application question thus found helpful exchange cooperation scenarios among designers writeup critically compare discuss specifically asking questions like get detail said sure youve interpreted correctly last measure sometimes even asked interviewees later whether detail matched reality purpose feedback workshop end users involved quite useful theoretical evaluation system design mentioned tried capture cooperative activity also motivation goals behind individual contributions activity another important aspect workload specific role scenario produced early stage new design already employ scenarios roleoriented benefit evaluation insert new design ie new cscw functionality scenario analyze role cooperative activity individual parts task change take instance first scenario old scenario system administrator department head asked open strongbox

directly involved design access control system presented contributed discussion workshop main goal presentation prototype help users understanding new functionality achieved integration traditional yes access control negotiation notification services based understanding wanted know users believed system could used support change work practices implementation details eg user interface prototype also discussed scope paper usability tests ran workshop evaluate interfaces configuring negotiation notification services presentation workshop based scenario drawn federal ministry concerning deletion address list common workspace one scenarios described together student volunteers played technology enhanced scenario script ensured cause prototype trouble screens two workstations fed beamers participants could see details workshop especially discussion contribution end users protocolled real world cooperation scenario captured imagination workshop attendees helped us first discover flaws base scenario secondly discuss design new functionality users wanted highlevel powerful configuration mechanisms negotiation service basic access rights supports result theoretical analysis additional workload data owner might problem concerning central question new functionality might support work practices users voiced rather diverse opinions interestingly head department said responsibilities eg deleting address lists assigned correctly negotiation time access would necessary furthermore high level individualized opposed standardized procedures would actually hinder cooperation single contributions would fit together points rather vehemently opposed subordinates stated one correct way assign responsibilities everyday work practice many things flux could cast fixed standardized structures point view statements justified head department wants clear best static picture going department subordinates actually deal surprises nonstandard situations everyday work exchange views exemplifies grouprelated aspects mentioned introduction cscw design take account cooperation scenario employed basis presentation helped supporting understanding end users subsequent discussion related work approach presented mainly builds work concerned putting end user work focus attention software development perspective due nature current state cscw discussion field still
