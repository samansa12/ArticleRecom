high level information contiguously giving users choice viewing specific section subsection levels demand motivation behind two interfaces analogous fisheye view supported furnas fisheye strategy provide balance local detail global context11 inherent problems using online textual documents compared customary leafing paper document using online replica printed document eg viewing document stable interface users must perform considerable amount scrolling get lost large document also since online version usually displays fewer items per screen compared printed page users suffer limited conveyance informational context 17 resultant disorientation viewing large document caused conceptual confusion concerning logical structure document 4 expandcontract interface preserves logical structure context stable interface since chapter titles preceding one chosen expansion often visible screen multipane interface overcomes conceptual deficiency constantly displaying high level chapter
