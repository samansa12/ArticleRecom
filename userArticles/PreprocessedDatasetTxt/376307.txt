demonstrates eect personality social context positive emotions compute intensity positive emotions con sequence agents unfriendliness high social threat diminish expression positive emotions eg happy

distinction allows agents cheat behavior expressing misleading emotion eg agent may express sad emotion pretending distressed emotional state although happy state option required entertainment purposes levels indirection beneficial 53 violations conventional practices despite fact obedience conventional practices expected realworld socioorganizational settings violations conventional practices occur particular seem dramatically interesting happens manager requests something secretary secretary refuses follow order consider following conversation fragment manager secretary quickly need copy secretary manager sorry busy right secretary violates conventional practices ignoring managers indirectly formulated order situation typically triggers negotiation process agent higher social role makes request explicit even directly refers role associated rights eg power request tasks subordinates moulin 21 emotion expression point view manager agent typically angry sec retary emotional state may express anger emotion due higher rank power scale crucial belief manager agents mental model eg blameworthymanagerconventional practice violated4 ie managers typically consider
