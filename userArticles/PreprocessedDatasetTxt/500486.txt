multimedia processing transmission require considerable battery power well network bandwidth especially true video processing transmission however reducing eec tive bit rate video transmissions allows lightweight video encoding 26 jones sivalingam agrawal chen decoding techniques utilized thereby reducing power con sumption severe bandwidth constraints lowpower situations video frames even carefully discarded transmission maintaining tolerable video quality agrawal et al 1998 research processing encoded video transmission low battery power conditions presented basic idea work decrease number bits transmitted wireless link response lowpower situations challenge accomplish goal preserving minimally degrading video quality decreasing number transmitted bits reduces energy consumption due reduced transmitter usage fact several studies shown transmission accounts third energy consumption video processing exchange portable device reduction number bits achieved one two ways reducing
