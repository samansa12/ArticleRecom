cryptographic solution implement access control hierarchy need access control hierarchy arises several different contexts one context managing information organization users divided different security classes depending access several cryptographic solutions proposed address problem solutions based generating cryptographic keys security class key lower level security class depends key security class higher hierarchy solutions use complex cryptographic techniques integrating existing systems may trivial others impractical requirement user security level wants access data lower levels intermediate nodes must traversed moreover access control policy conform hierarchical structure policy cannot handled existing solutions propose new solution overcomes mentioned shortcomings solution addresses
