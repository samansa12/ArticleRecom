ranking strategies navigation based query formulation navigating hypermedia retrieval system bears problem selecting item large number options available continue trajectory ranking options according criterion method ease task navigation number ranking strategies already proposed paper presents formalization concept ranking aforementioned strategies furthermore propose two strategies allowing personalized approach ranking b introduction ways introduction mass storage devices like cdrom mixed blessing true offer large amounts information sound video text however task finding right information become increasingly difficult although indexing information somewhat reduces complexity user may clear overview indices resident index insights achieved longtime use index therefore novice searchers need large amount support order make full use index item index space numerous links related items traveled amount possible roads travel may cause user diverge original train thought unintentionally order keep user right track could necessary introduce ordering different trajectories available first approach would present options available manner take previous decisions account

ranking strategies given set options following strategies may utilized achieve ranking options random options ranked random way convenience adopt policy ranking permutation options frequency based previous access users option assigned rank since quite possible links equally frequented ranking always permutation options time stamp link option created recently assigned higher ranking older ones static links created time ranking always permutation medium links leading nontextual information assigned higher ranking quite possible multiple options medium cases ranking according strategy result partial order knowledge gain rank options way choosing link maximize searchers gain knowledge furthermore author reported many cases users interested previously visited nodes seems imply ranking previously visited node receive lowest ranking interesting question therefore rank strategy assigns previous focus strategies need applied entire session could different strategy used different stages search process moreover stage possible one strategy used instance n options first 4 could ranked according strategy 1 next 4 could ranked according strategy also could choose partially rank n options

drawback instance frequencybased approach searcher made part faceless group users presumed interests even though collaborative approach benefits would like add personal touch ranking also strategies previous actions taken searcher reflect current interest taken account propose add sense dynamic behavior ranking paper introduce two different kinds ranking search target rank options based much bring searcher closer descriptor unknown user highly important history based rank options based previously exhibited behavior 422 random ranking basically meaningful ranking merely gives user feeling

increases searchers knowledge low one way view knowledge examining subset documents viewed thus far viewing indirect ie marking descriptor direct ie reading document current knowledge k gain knowledge fl offered choosing option e expressed definition 43 use definition ranking options option characterizes large number previously unread documents get high ranking hand since previous focus already

interests searcher eg frequencybased ranking works data gathered previous trajectories section presents strategies take current interest searcher account 51 search target based ranking principle search action effect labeling certain regions hyperindex less likely interest searcher instance suppose hyperindex subject means transportation subdivided motorized non motorized motorized marked relevant unlikely searcher time future mark bicycle relevant sequence search actions regarded could possible hypothesize likely region searcher interested search target singled searcher continues moving toward region belief hypothesis increase searcher moves away region belief hypothesis decrease could even possible hypothesis restated viz new search target derived subject section introduce notion target probabilities 511 basic definitions interesting way model effect search path assigning socalled target probability p djs descriptor probability expresses probability descriptor relevant information need given current search path effect extending search path option e expressed definition 51 1where w weight assign previous decisions general novice searchers best served low weight whereas experienced searchers greater benefit high weight settings strict merely defaults searcher ultimate control actual value weight decreased increased continuation probability cdje probability reaching e making berry mainly determined network topology every decision causes target probability descriptor fluctuate decisions increase target probability deal mainly moving towards descriptor decisions decrease descriptors target probability example decision instance searcher moves away descriptor suppose descriptor say f marked increase target probability ie p f jp increased much last action p example might case searcher moved part hyperindex terminates descriptor without branching hyperindex might called hairy hyperindex see eg 10 order compare descriptors increase target probability look relative increase target probability instance descriptor ds target probability rises 01 015 whereas descriptor es target probability rises 005 01 e largest relative increase even though absolute increase equal definition 52 search target search path p descriptor f maximizes jpwhen able point certain descriptor search target distance function descriptors allows us define ranking options rule thumb ranking hence question option offers shortest route search target option closest search target therefore receives highest rank lemma 51 search path p search target element towardsp special property target probability leaving descriptor results lower target probability descriptor hence previous focus definitely able become search target consequently previous focus never ranked first interesting situation arises n descriptors lay claim title search target case choose descriptor lies closest current focus another course action would find descriptor c serves common ancestor candidate search targets label descriptor search target search path constructed twice first history w history w 0 one would expect target probabilities hence radiation coefficients differ order construct search path cases user would select different ranked options eg option e descriptor ranked first history w used might ranked second third anything first history w 0 used would lead us expect different weights history used different rankings result 52 history based ranking previous section mentioned possible decide whether search path consis tent search path p already constructed reflects interest searcher order guide searcher way would maintain exhibited behavior interesting strategy ranking one descriptors ranked according degree uphold consis tency suppose e option current focus option create imaginary search path presuppose searcher choose e mark descriptor berry path analyzed order determine inconsistency inconsistency derived option ranked low contrast inconsistency derived option gets high ranking option expected change previously shown interest either narrowing deviating need exists assign measure option expressing much disturbs behavior order search path inconsistent occur two search actions j contradict distinguish two possibilities contradictions 1 action marks descriptor relevant action j rejects descriptor e similar 2 action marks descriptor relevant action j marks descriptor e relevant dissimilar order decide whether two descriptors similar assume availability similarity function similarity descriptors decided number ways one approach mentioned 11 furthermore two thresholds similarity two descriptors falls call descriptors dissimilar whereas similarity exceeds call similar finally conflicting search actions occur within window h window used support users different levels experience novice users may select small window value whereas expert searchers may select large window value definition 53 search path rendered inconsistent due two conflicting search actions j level inconsistency search path given suppose searcher constructed search path focus information countries western europe available eg france belgium searcher asks ranking countries since low countries rejected countries like instance belgium receive low ranking 2 521 selecting lowranked link important question asked happens user chooses disregard suggested ranking instead selects lowranked link user marks destination link relevant result would inconsistent path one reason searcher abandon certain thread interest consequence information encountered different information need formed instance searcher shown interest subject interest subject b triggered certain information dealing subject also deals subject b subject b sufficiently explored searcher might return original train thought subject 6 test results section return concept ranking based search target test strategy certain hyperindex first introduce technique compare two target distributions 61 basic definitions suppose constructed two search paths p q search paths give rise target distribution p djp p djq respectively p q consist n focus shift actions interesting measure compare target distributions entropy see eg 6 ep defined d2d evenly distributed target probability entropy relatively high contrast target distribution distinguished peaks ie descriptors markedly high target probability entropy remain rather low example 61 suppose four descriptors b c following table shows example target probabilities associated entropy b c ep 44441111183999looking target probabilities see probability concentrates descriptor whereas descriptors probability decreases consequence entropy decreasesfor examples follow section present graphs show entropy two search paths 62 random ranking vs search target based ranking section compare choosing option random choosing option based close option search target options ranked random choose first option expectation case target probability show tendency concentrate select set descriptors would result flat distribution hence high entropy secondly construct search path selecting option highest radiation coefficient expectation case target probability become markedly high specific set descriptors graph figure 7 shows entropy search target2931333537 entropy step ranked random figure 7 entropy random vs search target ranking based ranked path decreases constantly search target options ranked random shows increase entropy initial decrease entropy first last figure 8 effect rank selection 63 selecting lowranked option interesting test would compare entropies distribution would arise following two strategies selecting rank used 1 select option highest rank 2 select option lowest rank selecting highest ranked descriptor would bring searcher closer search target whereas selecting lowest ranked descriptor would result moving away search target although nothing wrong selecting lowranked descriptor every persistently would prevent target distribution becoming markedly high specific descriptor graph figure 8 shows resulting entropy search path constructed selecting first ranked option solid line entropy search path constructed selecting last ranked option seen selecting first rank leads lower entropy ie descriptor markedly higher target probability ensues 64 influence history finally show effect varying weight assign previous decisions case follow policy always selecting highest ranked descriptor previous decisions become important would expect moving certain direction would inhibit target probability concentrating certain set consequently entropy would decrease less quickly graph figure 9 see doubling weight previous decisions causes entropy decrease less rapidly conclusions paper given formalization concept ranking formalization number existing ranking strategies formalized furthermore presented two strategies ranking take account behavior searcher exhibited figure 9
