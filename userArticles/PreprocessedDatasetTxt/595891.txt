argument valid iff updating information state premises order given results state conclusion accepted one interesting features update semantics order sentences text occur important general case correctly reflects fact changing order sentences text general produce different story need even coherent consider example following two examples someone knocking doorit might johnit mary someone

semantics updates always imply increase information sense update information state oe always results state subset oe ie oeoe oe mean sentences accepted first state also accepted updated state typical case state oe containing two worlds w v state agent know whether p true state 3p accepted soon agent learns p case p considered possible anymore state oep 3p accepted 3 dynamic epistemic semantics
