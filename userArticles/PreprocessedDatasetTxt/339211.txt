though subset servicetime distribution tend highly variable eg reflected squared coefficient variation scv variance divided square mean high variability turn tend degrade performance mgs queue subset customers may initially classified many ways one way specifically want consider service time may happen customers service requirements known least accurately estimated upon arrival consider classifying customers according service times partition positive halfline finitely many disjoint subintervals let customers service times common subinterval belong class clearly partitioning customers according service times tends reduce variability ie variability within class usually less overall variability ways formalize see whitt 1985a since infinitely many possible ways partition service times subintervals infinitely many possible designs thus want quick method evaluating candidate designs purpose propose previous mgs approximations whitt 1992 1993 customer classes specified outset natural formulate design problem optimization problem goal minimize total number servers used requiring class meet specified performance requirement eg steadystate probability classi customer wait less equal

alternatives larger problems solved approximately exploiting two basic principles first advantage partitioning usually stems separating short service times long ones thus tend put classes similar servicetime distributions subset many cases partition according service times possible rank order classes according usual size service times may reasonable restrict attention partitions two classes appear together unless classes ranked two also belong partitions easily characterized boundary point ordering second principle expect large number subsets partition large number tends violate
